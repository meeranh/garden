## An Invitation (64-68)

After establishing its position on Jesus, the surah extends an invitation:

> *"Say: O People of the Book, come to a word that is equal between us and you, that we worship none but God, and associate nothing with Him, and that none of us take others as lords besides God."* (64)

**People of the Book** is the Quran's term for Jews and Christians, people who received earlier scriptures. The invitation isn't "become Muslim." It's: let's agree on what we already share. One God, no partners, no intermediaries.

## Abraham Again (65-68)

The argument from Al-Baqarah returns:

> *"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a hanif, a Muslim (one who submits to God). And he was not of the polytheists."* (67)

Judaism and Christianity are named after historical developments that came *after* Abraham. He predates both labels. The Quran's claim: Islam is the original, not the newcomer.

## Not All the Same (69-115)

The surah makes a distinction within the People of the Book. They're not treated as one block.

Some are honest and faithful:

> *"Among the People of the Book is a community that stands in prayer during the night, reciting the verses of God, and they prostrate. They believe in God and the Last Day, they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten to do good deeds. Those are among the righteous."* (113-114)

Others are not. Some distort scripture, break covenants, and hide the truth for personal gain.

The point: people are judged by their *actions*, not their label. Being from the People of the Book doesn't automatically make you righteous or corrupt.

## A Warning on Alliances (118-120)

The surah warns Muslims about taking *close confidants* from outside the community who may not have their best interests at heart.

This is specific to the political situation in Medina. Some people who outwardly supported the Muslims were actually working against them. The advice: be careful who you trust with your inner affairs.

This is *political* advice for a community at war, not a blanket statement about friendship with non-Muslims. The earlier verses just praised righteous People of the Book.
