title: Angle Measure

## What is an Angle?

An angle measures **rotation**.

Start with a ray called the **initial side**. Rotate it around a fixed point. Where it lands is the **terminal side**.

The amount of rotation is the angle.

## Direction Matters

- **Positive angles**: counterclockwise rotation
- **Negative angles**: clockwise rotation

The same position can be reached by rotating either direction.

## Degrees

One way to measure angles.

A full rotation = **360°**

| Fraction of circle | Degrees |
|-------------------|---------|
| Full | 360° |
| Half | 180° |
| Quarter | 90° |
| Sixth | 60° |
| Eighth | 45° |
| Twelfth | 30° |

> Why 360? The Babylonians chose it because 360 has many divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12...

## Radians

A more natural way to measure angles.

One **radian** is the angle where the arc length equals the radius.

::math/foundations/trigonometry/angles-unit-circle/radian-measure

---

Since circumference = $2\pi r$, a full circle has arc length $2\pi r$.

Dividing by the radius $r$: a full rotation = $2\pi$ **radians**.

| Degrees | Radians |
|---------|---------|
| 360° | $2\pi$ |
| 180° | $\pi$ |
| 90° | $\frac{\pi}{2}$ |
| 60° | $\frac{\pi}{3}$ |
| 45° | $\frac{\pi}{4}$ |
| 30° | $\frac{\pi}{6}$ |

## Converting Between Degrees and Radians

The key relationship:

$$\pi \text{ radians} = 180°$$

**Degrees to radians:** multiply by $\frac{\pi}{180}$

**Radians to degrees:** multiply by $\frac{180}{\pi}$

---

**Examples:**

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
45° &= 45 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad}
\end{aligned}$$

</div>

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2\pi}{3} \text{ rad} &= \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120°
\end{aligned}$$

</div>

## Standard Position

An angle is in **standard position** when:
- The vertex is at the origin
- The initial side lies on the positive x-axis

This gives us a consistent way to talk about angles.

## Coterminal Angles

**Coterminal angles** share the same terminal side.

They differ by full rotations: add or subtract $360°$ (or $2\pi$).

::math/foundations/trigonometry/angles-unit-circle/coterminal-angles

---

**Examples of coterminal angles:**

- $30°$, $390°$, $-330°$ are all coterminal
- $\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\frac{9\pi}{4}$, $-\frac{7\pi}{4}$ are all coterminal

> To find a coterminal angle between $0°$ and $360°$, keep adding or subtracting $360°$ until you're in range.

## Why Radians?

Radians make calculus formulas simple.

The derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$ **only if** $x$ is in radians.

In degrees, you'd get an ugly constant: $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x°) = \frac{\pi}{180}\cos(x°)$

> When no unit is specified, assume **radians**.
