## What is a Set?

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects.

---

**Examples from everyday life:**

- A bag of marbles — that's a set of marbles
- Your playlist — that's a set of songs
- Your contacts list — that's a set of people

---

## Writing Sets

We use **curly braces** to write sets:

$$\{1, 2, 3\}$$

This is a set containing 1, 2, and 3.

---

**More examples:**

| Set | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| $\{a, b, c\}$ | A set of letters |
| $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ | A set of even numbers |
| $\{\text{apple}, \text{banana}\}$ | A set of fruits |

---

## Two Important Rules

::set-basics

---

### Rule 1: No Duplicates

$$\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3\} = \{1, 2, 3\}$$

Duplicates are ignored. Each element appears **only once**.

> A set cares about *what's in it*, not *how many times* you wrote it.

---

### Rule 2: Order Doesn't Matter

$$\{1, 2, 3\} = \{3, 1, 2\} = \{2, 3, 1\}$$

A set is just a collection — there's no "first" or "last" element.

> A set cares about *what's in it*, not *what order* you wrote it.

---

## Set Membership

How do we say "this thing is in the set"?

---

**The symbol $\in$** means "is an element of" or "belongs to":

$$2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$$

> This reads: "2 **is in** the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$"

---

**The symbol $\notin$** means "is NOT an element of":

$$5 \notin \{1, 2, 3\}$$

> This reads: "5 **is not in** the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$"

---

**Practice:**

| Statement | True or False? |
|-----------|----------------|
| $3 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ | True |
| $7 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ | False |
| $a \in \{a, b, c\}$ | True |
| $d \notin \{a, b, c\}$ | True |

---

## The Empty Set

A set with **nothing in it** is called the **empty set**.

---

**Two ways to write it:**

- $\{\}$ — curly braces with nothing inside
- $\emptyset$ — the special empty set symbol

---

Think of it as an empty bag — still a bag, just nothing inside.

---

**Key facts about the empty set:**

- $x \notin \emptyset$ is true for **any** $x$ (nothing is in it)
- There is only **one** empty set (all empty sets are equal)

---

## Set-Builder Notation

Sometimes listing every element is impossible or tedious.

Instead, we describe a set by a **rule**:

$$\{x \mid x \text{ is an even number}\}$$

> This reads: "The set of all $x$ **such that** $x$ is an even number."

---

**The vertical bar** $\mid$ means "**such that**."

Some books use a colon instead: $\{x : x > 0\}$

---

**Examples:**

| Set-builder notation | Meaning | As a list |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|
| $\{x \mid x > 0\}$ | All positive numbers | $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ |
| $\{x \mid x^2 = 4\}$ | Numbers whose square is 4 | $\{-2, 2\}$ |
| $\{n \mid n \text{ is prime}\}$ | All prime numbers | $\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \ldots\}$ |

---

## Common Number Sets

Some sets are used so often they have special symbols:

| Symbol | Name | Elements |
|--------|------|----------|
| $\mathbb{N}$ | Natural numbers | $\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | Integers | $\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | Rational numbers | All fractions $\frac{a}{b}$ where $b \neq 0$ |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | Real numbers | All numbers on the number line |

---

**Why these letters?**

- $\mathbb{N}$ — **N**atural
- $\mathbb{Z}$ — **Z**ahlen (German for "numbers")
- $\mathbb{Q}$ — **Q**uotient (fractions are quotients)
- $\mathbb{R}$ — **R**eal

---

> **Note:** Some definitions include 0 in the natural numbers. We use $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ here.
