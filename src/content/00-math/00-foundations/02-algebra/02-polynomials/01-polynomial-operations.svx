## What's a Polynomial?

An expression with variables and coefficients, using only:
- Addition and subtraction
- Multiplication
- Non-negative integer exponents (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

---

## Degree

The **degree** is the highest exponent in the polynomial.

---

## What's NOT a Polynomial

- $\frac{1}{x}$ — negative exponent ($x^{-1}$)
- $\sqrt{x}$ — fractional exponent ($x^{1/2}$)
- $2^x$ — variable in the exponent

---

## Adding and Subtracting

Combine **like terms** (same variable and exponent).

$(3x^2 + 2x) + (5x^2 - x) = 8x^2 + x$

---

## Multiplying

Distribute each term to every term in the other polynomial.

::math/foundations/algebra/polynomials/multiply

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
(x + 2)(x + 3) &= x \cdot x + x \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 3 \\
               &= x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 \\
               &= x^2 + 5x + 6
\end{aligned}$$

</div>
