title: Properties of Real Numbers

## Why Do These Matter?

Every time you simplify an expression or solve an equation, you're using certain rules.

These rules aren't arbitrary. They're the **properties** that make algebra work.

---

## Closure

When you add or multiply two real numbers, you always get a real number.

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/closure

You can't "escape" the real numbers through addition or multiplication. The result is always real.

---

## Commutative Property

**Order doesn't matter.**

$$a + b = b + a$$
$$a \times b = b \times a$$

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/commutative

> *Commute* means to travel. The numbers can swap places.

---

## Associative Property

**Grouping doesn't matter.**

$$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
$$(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$$

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/associative

> *Associate* means to group. You can regroup however you like.

---

## Identity Property

There's a **"do nothing"** number for each operation.

- **Additive identity:** $a + 0 = a$
- **Multiplicative identity:** $a \times 1 = a$

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/identity

Adding zero or multiplying by one leaves the number unchanged.

---

## Inverse Property

Every number has an **"undo"** number.

- **Additive inverse:** $a + (-a) = 0$
- **Multiplicative inverse:** $a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$ (where $a \neq 0$)

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/inverse

> The inverse brings you back to the identity.

---

## Distributive Property

Multiplication **distributes** over addition.

$$a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$$

::math/foundations/algebra/properties/distributive

This is the bridge between multiplication and addition. It's why you can expand brackets.

---

## Using These Properties

Why can you rewrite $2x + 3x$ as $5x$?

**Distributive property:** $(2 + 3) \times x = 5x$

Why can you rearrange $3 + x + 7$ to $x + 10$?

**Commutative:** $3 + x + 7 = x + 3 + 7$
**Associative:** $x + (3 + 7) = x + 10$

Every algebraic manipulation uses these six properties.
