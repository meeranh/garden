## The Problem

Radio spectrum is **expensive and limited**. But mobile networks need to serve *millions* of users across entire cities.

You can't just use one frequency for everyone. Too many people would interfere with each other.

> **The solution:** Divide the coverage area into small **cells**, and **reuse** the same frequencies in cells that are *far apart*.

---

## Cells and Base Stations

A **cell** is a geographic area served by one base station (tower).

::wireless/gsm/fundamentals/cell-layout

Instead of one giant tower trying to cover everything, you use *many smaller cells*. Each cell handles users in its area.

**Why cells?**
- Smaller area = fewer users per cell = *less congestion*
- Lower power needed = *longer battery life* for phones
- Same frequencies can be reused in *distant* cells

---

## The Cluster Concept

You can't use the same frequency in **neighboring** cells. They'd interfere.

So you group cells into a **cluster**. Within a cluster, *every cell uses different frequencies*.

::wireless/gsm/fundamentals/frequency-reuse

Once you finish one cluster, you **repeat the pattern**. Cells using the same frequency are now *far apart*.

> A **cluster** is the smallest group of cells that uses the complete set of available frequencies.

---

## Cluster Size

Common cluster sizes: **3, 4, 7, 12**

| Cluster Size | Frequencies per Cell | Reuse Distance |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 3 | High | Short |
| 4 | Medium-High | Medium |
| 7 | Medium | Long |
| 12 | Low | Very Long |

**Smaller cluster** = more frequencies per cell = higher capacity

**Larger cluster** = frequencies reused farther apart = less interference

---

## Co-Channel Interference

When two cells use the **same frequency**, their signals can overlap. This is **co-channel interference**.

::wireless/gsm/fundamentals/co-channel-interference

The *closer* the cells, the *worse* the interference. Users hear noise, calls drop, data slows down.

> **Co-channel interference** is the main factor limiting how small your cluster can be.

---

## The Trade-off

::wireless/gsm/fundamentals/cluster-tradeoff

You want the **smallest cluster** that still gives *acceptable* call quality.

- Too small: interference *ruins* calls
- Too large: *wasting* capacity

---

## Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)

**SIR** measures how strong your wanted signal is compared to interference.

$$\text{SIR} = \frac{\text{Signal Power}}{\text{Interference Power}}$$

Higher SIR = *better quality*. You need a minimum SIR for acceptable calls (typically 12-18 dB for voice).

> The **most important criterion** for choosing cluster size is maintaining adequate SIR.

---

## Calculating Capacity

**Example:** You have 7 MHz of spectrum. Each carrier needs 200 kHz. You use a 7-cell cluster.

| Step | Calculation | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Total carriers | 7 MHz / 0.2 MHz | 35 carriers |
| Carriers per cell | 35 / 7 | 5 carriers |

More carriers per cell = more simultaneous calls.

---

## Spectral Efficiency

**Spectral efficiency** = how well you use your spectrum.

If you compare cluster N and cluster M, where N > M:

| Cluster | Frequencies per Cell | Spectral Efficiency |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| N (larger) | Fewer | Lower |
| M (smaller) | More | **Higher** |

> **Smaller clusters are more spectrally efficient**, but *only if* interference stays acceptable.

---

## Summary

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Cell** | Area served by one base station |
| **Cluster** | Group of cells using all available frequencies |
| **Frequency reuse** | Same frequency used in distant cells |
| **Co-channel interference** | Interference from cells on same frequency |
| **SIR** | Signal quality measure (signal vs interference) |
| **Cluster size trade-off** | Smaller = more capacity but more interference |
