title: Gain and Directivity

## The Lightbulb vs The Flashlight

Imagine you have a **lightbulb** and a **flashlight**, both using the *same battery*.

---

The **lightbulb** spreads light in *all* directions.

Stand anywhere around it, and you see some glow.

---

The **flashlight** focuses light in *one* direction.

- Stand **in front** of it, and it's *blinding*
- Stand **behind** it, and there's *nothing*

---

**Same power. Different distribution.**

The flashlight isn't creating *more* light. It's **concentrating** the same light into a *smaller area*.

> This is **exactly** how directional antennas work.

---

## The Isotropic Antenna

In theory, there's a perfect "lightbulb antenna" that radiates **equally in all directions**.

We call it an **isotropic antenna**.

---

Here's the thing:

> **It doesn't actually exist.** You can't build one.

But it's incredibly useful as a *reference point* for comparing real antennas.

::isotropic-vs-directional

---

## Directivity

> **Directivity** measures how much an antenna *focuses* its power compared to an isotropic antenna.

---

If an antenna has **directivity of 10**, it means:

In its *strongest direction*, the power density is **10 times** what an isotropic antenna would produce.

---

**Think of it like water pressure.**

A garden hose and a pressure washer might use the *same water flow*. But the pressure washer **focuses** it through a tiny nozzle.

> Same input. **More concentrated** output.

---

## From Directivity to Gain

Directivity is the *theoretical* best case. It assumes a **perfect antenna** with *no losses*.

---

**Real antennas aren't perfect.**

Some power gets absorbed by:

- **Antenna materials** (metal resistance)
- **Cables** (signal loss)
- **Connectors** (impedance mismatches)

This lost power turns into **heat**.

---

**Antenna efficiency** tells us how much of the input power *actually* gets radiated:

$$\eta = \frac{P_{\text{radiated}}}{P_{\text{input}}}$$

> - **$P_{\text{input}}$** = power you *feed into* the antenna
> - **$P_{\text{radiated}}$** = power that *actually leaves* as radio waves
> - The difference is **lost as heat**

An efficiency of **0.8**? That's *80% radiated*, *20% wasted*.

---

## Gain

> **Gain** is what you *actually* get in practice.

$$G = D \times \eta$$

**Gain** equals **directivity** times **efficiency**.

---

| Antenna Quality | Efficiency | Result |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **High-end** | 95% | Gain ≈ Directivity |
| **Typical** | 70-80% | Gain noticeably less |
| **Cheap** | 50% | *Half* the power wasted |

---

> If directivity is what *could* happen, **gain is what *does* happen**.

---

## The Unit: dBi

Gain numbers can get *huge*. A satellite dish might have a gain of 10,000.

Writing "10,000x" everywhere gets awkward. So we use **decibels (dB)** to *compress* big numbers into manageable ones.

---

**How it works:**

The logarithm asks: *"10 to what power gives me this number?"*

- $\log_{10}(10) = 1$ because $10^1 = 10$
- $\log_{10}(100) = 2$ because $10^2 = 100$
- $\log_{10}(1000) = 3$ because $10^3 = 1000$

> **Decibels turn multiplication into addition.** A gain of 1,000,000 becomes just **60 dB**.

---

$$G_{\text{dBi}} = 10 \log_{10}(G)$$

The **"i"** in dBi means *relative to isotropic*. It's our reference point.

| Linear Gain | dBi | Meaning |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| 1 | 0 dBi | Same as isotropic |
| 2 | 3 dBi | **2x** intensity |
| 10 | 10 dBi | **10x** intensity |
| 100 | 20 dBi | **100x** intensity |

---

> **The pattern:** Every **+3 dB** *doubles* power. Every **+10 dB** *multiplies by 10*.

---

## dBm: Decibels for Power

**dBi** compares gain to an isotropic antenna.

**dBm** measures *absolute power* relative to **1 milliwatt**.

$$P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{1 \text{ mW}}\right)$$

---

| Power | dBm |
|-------|-----|
| 1 mW | **0 dBm** |
| 10 mW | **10 dBm** |
| 100 mW | **20 dBm** |
| 1 W | **30 dBm** |

---

**Converting dBm back to Watts:**

$$P_{\text{watts}} = 10^{(P_{\text{dBm}} - 30) / 10}$$

---

**Example:**

> A 5G signal has received power **$P_r = -72$ dBm**. What is this in Watts?

**Solution:**

$$P = 10^{(-72 - 30) / 10} = 10^{-10.2} \approx 6.31 \times 10^{-11} \text{ W}$$

> That's **63 picowatts**. Receivers are *incredibly* sensitive.

---

## The Tradeoff

High directivity is a **double-edged sword**:

- **Great** if you know *exactly* where your receiver is
- **Terrible** if you need coverage in *all* directions

> **There's no free lunch.** Focusing power *somewhere* means taking it away from *everywhere else*.
