title: D2D Networks
---

**Normal communication:** Phone → Tower → Phone

What if the other person is *right next to you*?

> Why go through a tower 2 km away to talk to someone 5 meters away?

## Device-to-Device (D2D)

::@wireless/5g/d2d/d2d-concept

**D2D** lets devices talk *directly* to each other.

- No tower in the middle
- Shorter path = lower latency
- Offloads traffic from the network

---

## Why D2D?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lower latency** | Direct path, no tower roundtrip |
| **Offload traffic** | Less load on the network |
| **Works without coverage** | Useful in disasters, rural areas |
| **Energy efficient** | Shorter distance = less power |
| **Better for proximity** | Optimized for nearby devices |

## In-Band vs Out-Band D2D

The key question: **what frequencies does D2D use?**

---

### In-Band D2D

D2D uses the **same frequencies as cellular**.

::@wireless/5g/d2d/inband-d2d

Your phone talks to another phone using *LTE/5G spectrum*. The cellular network **controls** the D2D connection.

**Why?** The network already owns this spectrum. *No need to use anything else.*

**Problem:** D2D might interfere with regular cellular users. The network must carefully coordinate who uses what.

> *In-band = same frequencies as cellular, network is in charge.*

---

### Out-Band D2D

D2D uses **completely different frequencies** like WiFi or Bluetooth.

::@wireless/5g/d2d/outband-d2d

Your phone talks to another phone using *WiFi or Bluetooth*. The cellular network **has nothing to do with it**.

**Why?** WiFi and Bluetooth are *unlicensed*. Anyone can use them. No coordination needed with the cellular network.

**Think of it like:** AirDrop, WiFi Direct, Bluetooth file sharing. *Your carrier isn't involved at all.*

> *Out-band = different frequencies, network doesn't care.*

---

### The Difference

| | In-Band | Out-Band |
|--|---------|----------|
| **Frequencies** | Cellular (LTE/5G) | WiFi / Bluetooth |
| **Network involved?** | Yes, controls everything | No, independent |
| **Interference risk** | Can interfere with cellular | None to cellular |
| **Example** | Network-managed D2D | AirDrop, Bluetooth |

## D2D Use Cases

### Proximity Services

- Find nearby friends
- Local advertisements
- Social networking by location

*"Who's nearby?"*

---

### Public Safety

- First responders communicate when network is down
- Disaster scenarios
- Emergency coordination

*"Network failed, but we can still talk."*

---

### Content Sharing

- Share files with nearby devices
- Local multiplayer gaming
- Quick transfers without internet

*"Send this video to your phone directly."*

---

### Relay

- Phone acts as relay for another phone with weak signal
- Extends coverage
- Cooperative communication

*"I have signal, I'll relay for you."*

## Summary

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| **D2D** | Direct device-to-device, no tower |
| **In-band** | Uses cellular spectrum |
| **Out-band** | Uses WiFi/Bluetooth |
| **Underlay** | Shares spectrum with cellular |
| **Overlay** | Dedicated D2D spectrum |

> **D2D = shortcut.** *Why go through the tower when you're right next to each other?*
