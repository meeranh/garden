title: Question 2 - 4G LTE

## (2)(a) CoMP in LTE-Advanced

> Explain the Coordinated Multi-Point transmission and reception (CoMP) concept in LTE-A. A diagram should be used to support your analysis. *(8 marks)*

---

**CoMP** allows multiple cells to coordinate their transmissions to improve performance at **cell edges** where interference is highest.

**The Problem:** Users at cell edges receive weak signals and strong interference.

::cell-edge-problem

---

**Two CoMP Techniques:**

| Type | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Joint Transmission (JT)** | Multiple cells transmit the same data to the user simultaneously |
| **Coordinated Scheduling (CS/CB)** | Cells coordinate to avoid interfering with each other |

---

**Joint Transmission:**

::joint-transmission

- Both cells transmit to the user
- Signals combine constructively
- Dramatically improves cell-edge throughput

---

**Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming:**

::coordinated-scheduling

- Cells share scheduling information
- Each cell adjusts beamforming to minimize interference to neighboring users
- Lower backhaul requirements than JT

---

**Benefits of CoMP:**

- **Improved cell-edge performance** - up to 2-3x throughput increase
- **Reduced interference** - cells cooperate instead of competing
- **Better spectral efficiency** - same spectrum serves more users

## (2)(b) LTE Data Rate Calculation

> For an LTE Release 8 FDD system with 20 MHz spectrum, Type 1 frame, normal CP (7 symbols), and 90% effective bandwidth.

**LTE Data:**
- Radio Frame = 10 Sub-frames
- Sub-frame = 2 Time-slots = 1 ms
- Time-slot = 7 OFDM symbols
- Inter-carrier spacing = 15 kHz
- 32 QAM = 5 bits/symbol

### (i) Effective Downlink Data Rate

> Using 32 QAM and 2/3 encoding rate. *(10 marks)*

**Step 1: Number of Subcarriers**

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Effective BW} &= 20 \text{ MHz} \times 0.9 = 18 \text{ MHz} \\
\text{Subcarriers} &= \frac{18 \text{ MHz}}{15 \text{ kHz}} = 1200
\end{aligned}$$

</div>

**Step 2: Symbols per Second**

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Symbols per subframe} &= 7 \times 2 = 14 \\
\text{Subframes per second} &= 1000 \\
\text{Total symbols/sec} &= 1200 \times 14 \times 1000 = 16,800,000
\end{aligned}$$

</div>

**Step 3: Apply Modulation and Coding**

<div class="math-left">

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Raw bits/sec} &= 16,800,000 \times 5 = 84 \text{ Mbps} \\
\text{With 2/3 coding} &= 84 \times \frac{2}{3} = 56 \text{ Mbps}
\end{aligned}$$

</div>

> **Effective downlink data rate: 56 Mbps**

---

### (ii) Impact of 8x8 MIMO

> What is the impact on system capacity when 8x8 MIMO is used? *(2 marks)*

**8x8 MIMO** provides **8 spatial streams**, multiplying the capacity by 8:

$$\text{Capacity with MIMO} = 56 \times 8 = 448 \text{ Mbps}$$

> **With 8x8 MIMO: 448 Mbps** (8x increase)
