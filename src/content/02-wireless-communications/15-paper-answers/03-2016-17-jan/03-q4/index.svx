title: Question 4 - Mobility Management
---

## (4)(a) Home Address vs Care-of Address

> What is the difference between Home Address (HA) and Care of Address (CoA)? *(5 marks)*

---

| Address | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Home Address (HoA)** | Permanent address assigned to mobile node, never changes |
| **Care-of Address (CoA)** | Temporary address acquired in visited network |

---

**Home Address:**
- Assigned by home network
- Used by correspondent nodes to reach the mobile
- Remains constant regardless of location
- Identifies the mobile node globally

**Care-of Address:**
- Acquired when mobile enters foreign network
- Changes each time mobile moves to new network
- Used for actual packet delivery
- Registered with Home Agent

> **Key insight:** Correspondents always send to Home Address. The Home Agent redirects to the current Care-of Address.

## (4)(b) MIPv4 Home Agent and Foreign Agent

> Describe the roles of the Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) Home Agent (HA) and the MIPv4 Foreign Agent (FA) by the provision of a diagram. *(5 marks)*

**Home Agent (HA):**
- Router on the mobile's **home network**
- Maintains binding table (HoA → CoA mappings)
- Intercepts packets destined for mobile's home address
- **Tunnels** packets to mobile's current location
- Handles binding updates from mobile

**Foreign Agent (FA):**
- Router on the **visited network**
- Advertises its presence (Agent Advertisement)
- Provides Care-of Address to visiting mobiles
- **De-tunnels** packets from Home Agent
- Delivers packets to mobile node

---

## (4)(c) How CN Sends Packets to MT in MIPv4

> Describe how the CN (Corresponding Node) sends packets to the MT (Mobile Terminal) in the case where Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) is employed. *(5 marks)*

---

::triangle-routing

---

**Steps:**

1. **CN sends to Home Address** - CN doesn't know mobile has moved, sends to HoA
2. **HA intercepts** - Home Agent receives packet (mobile not on home network)
3. **HA tunnels to CoA** - HA encapsulates packet, sends to Care-of Address
4. **FA de-tunnels** - Foreign Agent removes outer header
5. **FA delivers to MT** - Mobile Terminal receives original packet

---

**This creates "Triangle Routing":**
- Packets go: CN → HA → FA → MT
- Inefficient if CN and MT are close but HA is far
- MIPv6 solves this with **route optimization**

## (4)(d) HMIPv6 vs Fast MIPv6 vs Proxy MIPv6

> Discuss the similarities and differences of Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) as compared to Fast and Proxy MIPv6. *(5 marks)*

---

**HMIPv6 (Hierarchical):**

::hmipv6

- Introduces **MAP (Mobility Anchor Point)** for local mobility
- Local moves only update MAP, not Home Agent
- Reduces signaling to home network

---

**Fast MIPv6:**

::fmipv6

- Reduces **handover latency** by anticipating moves
- Pre-configures new CoA before handover completes
- Near-zero packet loss during handover

---

**Proxy MIPv6:**

::pmipv6

- **Network-based** mobility (mobile doesn't participate)
- MAG (Mobile Access Gateway) handles mobility signaling
- Simpler for mobile devices, no MIP stack needed

---

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | HMIPv6 | FMIPv6 | PMIPv6 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Goal** | Reduce signaling | Reduce latency | Simplify mobile |
| **New Entity** | MAP | None | MAG, LMA |
| **Mobile Involvement** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Best For** | Frequent local moves | Real-time apps | Simple devices |

**Similarities:**
- All extend/improve base Mobile IP
- All maintain session continuity
- All aim to improve handover performance
