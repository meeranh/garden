title: Question 3 - Cloud Computing
---

## (3)(a) Cloud Deployment Models

> Describe the deployment models of Cloud Computing based on location and distribution. *(5 marks)*

---

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Public Cloud** | Resources shared among multiple organizations, owned by provider | Startups, web apps |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated to single organization, on-premises or hosted | Banks, healthcare |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combination of public and private | Burst capacity, sensitive data |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared by organizations with common concerns | Government, research |

---

**Public Cloud:**
- Lowest cost, pay-per-use
- Managed by third party (AWS, Azure, Google)
- Less control, shared resources

**Private Cloud:**
- Maximum control and security
- Higher cost (own infrastructure)
- Dedicated resources

**Hybrid Cloud:**
- Best of both worlds
- Keep sensitive data private, burst to public for peaks

---

## (3)(b) Cloud Delivery Models

> Provide the cloud delivery models and describe for each model one example using Amazon, Google or Microsoft products. *(5 marks)*

---

| Model | What You Get | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **IaaS** | Virtual machines, storage, networks | **AWS EC2** |
| **PaaS** | Platform to build/deploy apps | **Google App Engine** |
| **SaaS** | Ready-to-use applications | **Microsoft 365** |

---

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
- **AWS EC2** - rent virtual servers by the hour
- You manage: OS, middleware, applications
- Provider manages: hardware, virtualization, networking

**PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
- **Google App Engine** - deploy code, platform handles scaling
- You manage: application code
- Provider manages: runtime, OS, servers

**SaaS (Software as a Service):**
- **Microsoft 365** - use Word, Excel, Teams in browser
- You manage: your data
- Provider manages: everything else

## (3)(c) Performance Metrics

> Give and compare at least three user-perceived and three provider-centric performance metrics. *(5 marks)*

---

**User-Perceived Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Response Time** | Time from request to response |
| **Availability** | Uptime percentage (e.g., 99.9%) |
| **Throughput** | Requests handled per second |

---

**Provider-Centric Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Resource Utilization** | CPU, memory, storage usage |
| **Energy Efficiency** | Power consumption per workload |
| **Cost per Transaction** | Operational cost to serve requests |

---

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | User-Perceived | Provider-Centric |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Experience quality | Operational efficiency |
| **Goal** | Minimize latency, maximize uptime | Minimize cost, maximize utilization |
| **Conflict** | Users want dedicated resources | Providers want to share resources |

> **Trade-off:** High resource utilization (good for provider) can hurt response time (bad for user).

## (3)(d) Emotion-Aware Mobile Cloud Computing

> Explain what is the emotion-aware mobile cloud computing and its applicability by the way of one paradigm. *(5 marks)*

---

**Emotion-Aware Mobile Cloud Computing** detects user emotions via mobile sensors and adapts cloud services accordingly.

::emotion-flow

---

**How It Works:**

1. **Sensing** - mobile device captures facial expressions, voice tone, typing patterns
2. **Analysis** - cloud processes data using ML to detect emotion (happy, stressed, tired)
3. **Adaptation** - services adjust based on detected emotion

---

**Example Paradigm: Emotion-Aware Music Streaming**

| Detected Emotion | Service Adaptation |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Stressed | Play calming music, reduce notifications |
| Happy | Upbeat playlist, enable social features |
| Tired | Soft music, suggest break reminders |

---

**Applications:**

- **Healthcare** - detect depression, anxiety early
- **Education** - adapt learning pace to student frustration
- **Customer service** - route angry customers to senior agents
- **Driving** - alert drowsy drivers, adjust navigation voice
