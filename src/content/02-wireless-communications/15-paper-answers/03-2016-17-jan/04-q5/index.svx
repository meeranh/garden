title: Question 5 - Digital Modulation and Coding
---

## (5)(a) BASK, BFSK, QPSK Modulation

> Draw the Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK), Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) encoded/modulated signal for the following digital sequence (0100101101). *(6 marks)*

---

**Digital sequence:** `0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1`

---

**BASK (Binary Amplitude Shift Keying):**

::ask-modulation

- **0** = No signal (zero amplitude)
- **1** = Carrier signal (full amplitude)
- 1 bit per symbol

---

**BFSK (Binary Frequency Shift Keying):**

::fsk-modulation

- **0** = Low frequency carrier
- **1** = High frequency carrier
- 1 bit per symbol

---

**QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying):**

::qpsk-waveform

- 2 bits per symbol
- Sequence grouped: `01 00 10 11 01`
- Each pair maps to a phase: 00→0°, 01→90°, 10→180°, 11→270°

---

## (5)(b) BASK with 4 bits per Symbol

> For the digital sequence shown in (a), draw the Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK) encoded/modulated signal if each signal/symbol is represented by 4 bits. *(2 marks)*

---

**4-bit BASK (16-ASK):**

With 4 bits per symbol, we have **16 amplitude levels** (0-15).

Sequence grouped: `0100 1011 01xx`

| Symbol | Bits | Decimal | Amplitude |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 0100 | 4 | 4/15 of max |
| 2 | 1011 | 11 | 11/15 of max |
| 3 | 01xx | (padded) | - |

> Each symbol's amplitude is proportional to its decimal value.

## (5)(c) FSK Advantages and Disadvantages

> Describe advantages and disadvantages of Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) encoding. *(2 marks)*

---

**Advantages:**

- **Immune to amplitude noise** - information is in frequency, not amplitude
- **Simple to implement** - just switch between two oscillators
- **Good for noisy channels** - more robust than ASK

**Disadvantages:**

- **Bandwidth inefficient** - needs bandwidth for both frequencies
- **Lower data rate** - only 1 bit per symbol (binary FSK)
- **Complex receiver** - needs frequency discriminator

## (5)(d) 16-QAM Constellation Diagram

> Draw the constellation diagram for 16-QAM (16-Quadratic Amplitude Modulation) encoding. *(4 marks)*

---

::qam16-constellation

**16-QAM:**

- 16 points arranged in a 4×4 grid
- Each point represents 4 bits
- Uses both **amplitude** and **phase**
- Points at corners have highest amplitude

## (5)(e) Error Detection and Correction

> List two error detection and error correction mechanisms used in wireless communications. *(2 marks)*

---

**Error Detection:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CRC** | Cyclic Redundancy Check - polynomial division |
| **Parity bits** | Simple odd/even check |

**Error Correction:**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hamming codes** | Block code, corrects single-bit errors |
| **Convolutional codes** | Stream code, uses Viterbi decoding |

---

## (5)(f) Convolutional Codes vs Block Codes

> Compare Convolutional Codes to (linear) Block Codes and explain their use in the communication chain. *(4 marks)*

---

| Aspect | Block Codes | Convolutional Codes |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Input** | Fixed blocks (e.g., 4 bits) | Continuous stream |
| **Memory** | None (each block independent) | Has memory (shift register) |
| **Encoding** | Matrix multiplication | Shift register + XOR |
| **Decoding** | Syndrome lookup | Viterbi algorithm |
| **Latency** | Low (block-by-block) | Higher (sliding window) |
| **Example** | Hamming (7,4) | Rate 1/2, K=3 |

---

**Use in Communication Chain:**

1. **Block codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon)** - outer code, corrects burst errors
2. **Convolutional codes** - inner code, corrects random errors
3. **Interleaving** between them spreads burst errors

> **Turbo codes** and **LDPC** combine ideas from both for near-Shannon-limit performance.
