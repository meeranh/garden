## (4)(a) Smart City Design Using 5G

> Design the example of a smart city by utilising the 5G technology. *(10 marks)*

---

A smart city uses 5G's three use cases to connect everything:

| Use Case | Smart City Application |
|----------|------------------------|
| **eMBB** | HD surveillance, AR navigation |
| **URLLC** | Autonomous vehicles, emergency response |
| **mMTC** | Sensors, smart meters, parking |

---

**1. Smart Traffic Management (URLLC + mMTC)**

- Traffic lights with sensors detect vehicle flow in real-time
- Autonomous vehicles communicate with infrastructure (V2X)
- Emergency vehicles get automatic green lights
- Requires: ultra-low latency for safety-critical decisions

---

**2. Smart Grid (mMTC)**

- Millions of smart meters report energy usage
- Grid automatically balances supply and demand
- Detects faults and reroutes power instantly
- Requires: massive device connectivity, low power

---

**3. Public Safety (eMBB + URLLC)**

- HD cameras with AI detect incidents
- First responders stream live video from body cams
- Drones provide aerial views during emergencies
- Requires: high bandwidth, reliable connection

---

**4. Smart Healthcare (URLLC)**

- Remote patient monitoring via wearables
- Ambulances transmit patient vitals to hospital en route
- Potential for remote surgery
- Requires: ultra-reliable, low-latency links

---

**5. Network Slicing**

The operator creates **dedicated slices** for each service:

| Slice | Priority | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Emergency services | Highest | Guaranteed bandwidth, ultra-low latency |
| Traffic management | High | Low latency, medium bandwidth |
| Smart meters | Low | Best-effort, massive connections |

> Each slice is isolated, so a surge in smart meter traffic won't affect emergency services.

## (4)(b) Antenna Gain and Directivity

> Explain the concepts of antenna gain and directivity. *(5 marks)*

---

**Directivity**

How much an antenna focuses energy in a particular direction compared to an **isotropic antenna** (which radiates equally in all directions).

$$D = \frac{\text{Power density in max direction}}{\text{Average power density over all directions}}$$

- A flashlight has high directivity (focused beam)
- A light bulb has low directivity (radiates everywhere)

---

**Gain**

Gain = Directivity × Efficiency

$$G = \eta \cdot D$$

Where $\eta$ is the antenna efficiency (accounts for resistive losses, mismatches).

- **Gain** tells you the *actual* amplification in the preferred direction
- **Directivity** is the *theoretical* maximum if there were no losses
- Both are measured in **dBi** (relative to isotropic antenna)

> A typical WiFi antenna has gain of 2-5 dBi. A cellular base station dish might have 15-20 dBi.

## (4)(c) Convert dBm to Watts

> Assume that the 5G received power is $P_r$ = -72 dBm. What will be the receive power in Watts? *(5 marks)*

---

**Formula:**

$$P(\text{mW}) = 10^{\frac{P(\text{dBm})}{10}}$$

**Step 1: Calculate power in mW**

$$P = 10^{\frac{-72}{10}} = 10^{-7.2} = 6.31 \times 10^{-8} \text{ mW}$$

**Step 2: Convert mW to Watts**

$$P = 6.31 \times 10^{-8} \times 10^{-3} = 6.31 \times 10^{-11} \text{ W}$$

> **Answer: $P_r$ = 63.1 pW** (picowatts), or $6.31 \times 10^{-11}$ W

This is a very weak signal, but 5G receivers can work with signals as low as -100 dBm.
