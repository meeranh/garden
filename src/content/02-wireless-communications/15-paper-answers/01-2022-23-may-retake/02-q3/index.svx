## (3)(a) OFDM Advantages and Disadvantages

> OFDM is the modulation technique used by 4G LTE. What are the main advantages and disadvantages related to transmitter and receiver architecture of this technique? *(6 marks)*

---

**Advantages:**

- **Resilience to multipath** - narrow subcarriers experience flat fading, easier to equalize
- **Simple equalization** - single-tap equalizer per subcarrier (just multiply by a coefficient)
- **Spectral efficiency** - subcarriers overlap without interference (orthogonal)
- **Flexible bandwidth** - can use 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, or 20 MHz by changing number of subcarriers
- **Efficient implementation** - uses FFT/IFFT algorithms (fast, well-optimized)

**Disadvantages:**

- **High PAPR** - Peak-to-Average Power Ratio requires expensive linear amplifiers
- **Frequency offset sensitivity** - small carrier frequency errors cause inter-carrier interference
- **Strict synchronization** - requires accurate time and frequency sync between TX and RX
- **Cyclic prefix overhead** - wastes some bandwidth to prevent inter-symbol interference

> LTE uses SC-FDMA (not OFDM) for uplink to reduce PAPR and save phone battery.

## (3)(b) LTE Heterogeneous Networks

> LTE air interface can be deployed for inter-technology and intra-technology Heterogeneous Networks.

### (i) Carrier Aggregation in HetNets

> What type of Carrier Aggregation can be used in Heterogeneous Networks and how? *(7 marks)*

**Types of Carrier Aggregation:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Intra-band contiguous** | Adjacent carriers in same band |
| **Intra-band non-contiguous** | Separate carriers in same band |
| **Inter-band** | Carriers from different frequency bands |

---

**How CA works in HetNets:**

In a HetNet, macro cells and small cells often use **different frequency bands**:
- **Macro cell:** Low frequency (e.g., 800 MHz) for wide coverage
- **Small cell:** High frequency (e.g., 3.5 GHz) for high capacity

**Inter-band CA** allows a UE to:
1. Connect to the macro cell on the low band (for control signaling and coverage)
2. Simultaneously receive data from a small cell on the high band (for capacity)
3. Aggregate both carriers to increase total throughput

> This is called "dual connectivity" and allows seamless mobility while boosting speeds.

### (ii) Advantages of Relay Nodes

> Explain the advantages of relay nodes in Heterogeneous Networks? *(7 marks)*

**What is a Relay Node?**

A relay node (RN) is a low-power base station that connects to the core network **wirelessly** through a donor eNB, rather than via wired backhaul.

---

**Advantages:**

- **Extend coverage** - fills holes at cell edges, indoors, and shadow areas
- **No wired backhaul needed** - uses wireless link to donor eNB, reducing deployment cost
- **Quick deployment** - can be installed rapidly without fiber installation
- **Lower cost** - cheaper than deploying a full eNB with fiber
- **Capacity boost** - offloads traffic from macro cell in hotspot areas
- **Improved cell-edge performance** - users far from macro cell get better signal via relay
- **Flexible placement** - can be mounted on lamp posts, walls, or inside buildings
