## (2)(a) Driving Factors for 2G to 4G Evolution

> What are the major driving factors for the evolution of 2G to 4G technologies? *(6 marks)*

---

**1. Data Speed Demands**
- 2G was designed for voice, but users wanted internet, email, video
- Each generation increased speeds: 2G (64 kbps) → 3G (2 Mbps) → 4G (100+ Mbps)

**2. Spectral Efficiency**
- Limited spectrum is expensive, so each generation uses it more efficiently
- Better modulation (GMSK → QPSK → 64-QAM) and multiple access (TDMA → CDMA → OFDMA)

**3. Multimedia Applications**
- Video calling, streaming, gaming require high bandwidth and low latency
- 2G couldn't support these, driving upgrades

**4. Capacity**
- More users = more congestion
- Each generation supports more simultaneous users per cell

**5. Latency Reduction**
- Real-time apps (VoIP, gaming) need low delay
- 4G reduced latency to ~10 ms vs 2G's 300+ ms

**6. Cost Per Bit**
- Operators need to reduce cost of delivering data
- More efficient networks = cheaper data for users

## (2)(b) GSM Capacity Calculation

> The GSM Operator 'A' is allocated 2x6 MHz of spectrum. The technical parameters of the GSM air interface are:
> - TDMA and FDD
> - 8 Time Slots/TDMA Frame
> - One full duplex carrier = two frequencies (uplink + downlink)
> - Bandwidth of a carrier = 2x200 kHz

### (i) Number of Carriers per Cell

> What is the number of carriers/cell for a 7-cell cluster? *(8 marks)*

**Given:**
- Total spectrum: 2 x 6 MHz (6 MHz uplink + 6 MHz downlink)
- Carrier bandwidth: 200 kHz (per direction)
- Cluster size: 7 cells

**Step 1: Total carriers in system**

$$\text{Total carriers} = \frac{6 \text{ MHz}}{200 \text{ kHz}} = \frac{6000}{200} = 30 \text{ carriers}$$

**Step 2: Carriers per cell (frequency reuse)**

$$\text{Carriers per cell} = \frac{\text{Total carriers}}{\text{Cluster size}} = \frac{30}{7} = 4.28$$

> **Answer: 4 carriers per cell** (we round down since partial carriers aren't possible)

---

### (ii) Maximum Speech Calls per Cell

> What is the maximum number of speech calls possible in a cell? *(6 marks)*

**Given:**
- 4 carriers per cell
- 8 time slots per carrier

**Step 1: Total time slots**

$$\text{Total slots} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ slots}$$

**Step 2: Subtract control channels**

In GSM, typically 2 slots on the first carrier are reserved for control (BCCH, SDCCH).

$$\text{Traffic slots} = 32 - 2 = 30 \text{ slots}$$

> **Answer: 30 speech calls** (each call uses one time slot)
