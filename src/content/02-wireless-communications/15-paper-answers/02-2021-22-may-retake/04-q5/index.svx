## (5)(a) ITU 5G Triangle

> Draw and explain the ITU specified triangle of 5G. *(8 marks)*

---

The **ITU IMT-2020** framework defines 5G through three use case categories:

::itu-triangle

---

**1. eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)**

High-speed data for bandwidth-hungry applications.

- **Peak speed:** 20 Gbps
- **User experienced:** 100 Mbps
- **Use cases:** 4K/8K streaming, VR/AR, cloud gaming

---

**2. URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication)**

Mission-critical applications where delay = danger.

- **Latency:** under 1 ms
- **Reliability:** 99.999% (five nines)
- **Use cases:** Remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, industrial robots

---

**3. mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communication)**

Connecting billions of IoT devices.

- **Density:** 1 million devices per km²
- **Battery life:** 10+ years
- **Use cases:** Smart meters, agriculture sensors, asset tracking

---

| Use Case | Speed | Latency | Devices | Key Metric |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| **eMBB** | 20 Gbps | ~10 ms | Few | Throughput |
| **URLLC** | Medium | 1 ms | Few | Reliability |
| **mMTC** | Low | Relaxed | Millions | Density |

## (5)(b) 5G Vertical Market Case Study

> 5G technology will not be successful without penetrating the vertical markets. Write a short case study explaining how this penetration will be realised in a vertical market of your choice. *(12 marks)*

### Case Study: Smart Manufacturing (Industry 4.0)

**Why Manufacturing Needs 5G:**

Manufacturing is transforming into "Industry 4.0" with connected robots, digital twins, and automated quality control. This requires both **URLLC** (for robot control) and **mMTC** (for sensors).

---

**The Problem:**

A car manufacturer wants to automate their assembly line with collaborative robots (cobots). Current solutions fail because:

- **WiFi:** Too unreliable, interference from metal equipment
- **4G:** Latency too high (50-100 ms) for real-time robot control
- **Wired:** Limits robot mobility, expensive to reconfigure

---

**The 5G Solution:**

Deploy a **private 5G network** in the factory:

**1. Robot Control (URLLC)**
- Latency under 1 ms for real-time motion control
- Reliability 99.9999% for safety-critical operations

**2. Sensor Network (mMTC)**
- Thousands of sensors monitor temperature, vibration, quality
- Predictive maintenance prevents downtime

**3. AR for Workers (eMBB)**
- Workers wear AR glasses showing assembly instructions
- Remote expert assistance via live video

---

**Business Model: Private Network Slice**

| Component | Revenue Model |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Spectrum** | Annual license fee |
| **Infrastructure** | CAPEX + maintenance |
| **Network Slice** | Monthly SLA-based fee |

---

**Real-World Example:**

**Audi** deployed a private 5G network in their factory in Germany:
- Connects 400+ autonomous transport robots
- Latency under 1 ms for collision avoidance
- **Result:** 30% productivity increase

> **Key insight:** Manufacturers pay premium prices for guaranteed performance because factory downtime costs millions per hour.
