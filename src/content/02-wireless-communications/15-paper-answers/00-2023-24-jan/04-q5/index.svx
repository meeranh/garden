## (5)(a) Three Use Cases of 5G

> Which are the three use cases of 5G? Explain each use case in detail using diagrams where possible. *(8 marks)*

> *Learn more: [5G Requirements](/wireless-communications/5g/requirements)*

---

**1. eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband)**

High-speed data for bandwidth-hungry applications.

- **Peak speed:** 20 Gbps
- **Use cases:** 4K/8K video streaming, VR/AR, cloud gaming
- **Key feature:** Massive capacity in crowded areas (stadiums, concerts)

---

**2. URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication)**

Mission-critical applications where delay = danger.

- **Latency:** under 1 ms
- **Reliability:** 99.999%
- **Use cases:** Remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, industrial robots
- **Key feature:** Guaranteed delivery, no room for error

---

**3. mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communication)**

Connecting billions of IoT devices.

- **Density:** 1 million devices per km²
- **Use cases:** Smart cities, agriculture sensors, asset tracking
- **Key feature:** Low power, long battery life (10+ years), small data packets

---

| Use Case | Speed | Latency | Devices | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| **eMBB** | 20 Gbps | ~10 ms | Few | VR streaming |
| **URLLC** | Medium | 1 ms | Few | Remote surgery |
| **mMTC** | Low | Relaxed | Millions | Smart meters |

## (5)(b) Vertical Market Case Study: Healthcare

> Write a short case study explaining the business model to be applied in a vertical market of your choice. *(12 marks)*

---

**Why Healthcare Needs 5G**

Healthcare is a prime vertical market for 5G because it requires both **URLLC** (for remote surgery) and **mMTC** (for patient monitoring devices).

---

**Case Study: Remote Surgery**

**Problem:** Specialist surgeons are concentrated in major cities. Rural patients must travel long distances for complex procedures.

**5G Solution:** A surgeon in London operates a robotic arm in a rural hospital 200 miles away, using real-time HD video and haptic feedback.

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Latency under 1 ms** - surgeon's hand movements must be instant
- **Reliability 99.999%** - network failure during surgery is unacceptable
- **Bandwidth over 1 Gbps** - multiple 4K video streams of the surgical site

---

**Business Model: Network Slicing**

The hospital purchases a **dedicated network slice** from the operator:

- **Guaranteed QoS** - URLLC slice with reserved resources
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** - operator pays penalty if latency exceeds 1 ms
- **Premium pricing** - hospital pays more than consumer plans, but saves on patient transport and specialist travel

---

**Real-World Example:**

In 2019, a surgeon in China performed remote brain surgery on a patient 3,000 km away using 5G, with latency of just 2 ms. The procedure was successful.

---

**Revenue Model for Operators:**

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Slice rental** | Monthly fee for dedicated URLLC slice |
| **Per-procedure fee** | Charge per remote surgery performed |
| **Equipment** | Sell/lease 5G-enabled surgical robots |
| **Maintenance** | Ongoing support and SLA monitoring |

> **Key insight:** Vertical markets like healthcare pay premium prices for guaranteed performance, making them more profitable than consumer mobile.
