## (1)(a) WiFi Security Protocols

> Describe the security protocols used in the IEEE802.11 family (from a to ax). *(8 marks)*

> *Learn more: [Standards Organizations](/wireless-communications/standards-organizations)*

WiFi security evolved through four main protocols:

**WEP (802.11, 802.11a/b)**
- Wired Equivalent Privacy
- RC4 encryption with 40-bit or 104-bit keys
- **Broken** - IV (initialization vector) reuse makes it easy to crack

**WPA (interim fix for 802.11g)**
- Wi-Fi Protected Access
- Still RC4, but added TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
- Better key management, but still vulnerable

**WPA2 (802.11i, used in 802.11n/ac)**
- Uses **AES-CCMP** encryption (much stronger)
- Two modes: Personal (PSK) and Enterprise (802.1X)
- Solid security for many years

**WPA3 (802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6)**
- **SAE** (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) replaces PSK
- **Forward secrecy** - past traffic stays safe even if password cracked later
- Protected Management Frames mandatory
- 192-bit security suite for enterprise

| Standard | Security | Encryption | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| 802.11/a/b | WEP | RC4 | Broken |
| 802.11g | WPA | RC4 + TKIP | Weak |
| 802.11i/n/ac | WPA2 | AES-CCMP | Good |
| 802.11ax | WPA3 | AES + SAE | Current |

> **Evolution: WEP → WPA → WPA2 → WPA3**

## (1)(b) ITU Function and Sectors

> Explain the function of the ITU (International Telecommunications Union) and its three sectors. *(4 marks)*

> *Learn more: [Standards Organizations](/wireless-communications/standards-organizations)*

The **ITU** is a United Nations agency that coordinates global telecommunications and radio spectrum.

**Three Sectors:**

| Sector | Name | Function |
|--------|------|----------|
| **ITU-R** | Radiocommunication | Manages radio spectrum and satellite orbits |
| **ITU-T** | Telecommunication Standardization | Develops technical standards (e.g., H.264, G.711) |
| **ITU-D** | Development | Helps developing countries build telecom infrastructure |

> The ITU also allocates country codes, manages international numbering plans, and coordinates spectrum to prevent interference between countries.

## (1)(c) CSMA/CA Congestion Window

> Calculate the congestion window (CW) for the 3rd retransmission in the CSMA/CA protocol. The CW in the initial transmission is 63 slots. *(8 marks)*

> *Learn more: [CSMA/CA](/wireless-communications/wifi/csma-ca)*

In CSMA/CA, when a collision occurs, the congestion window **doubles** with each retransmission:

| Transmission | Calculation | CW |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Initial | - | 63 |
| 1st retransmission | 63 × 2 | 127 |
| 2nd retransmission | 127 × 2 | 255 |
| **3rd retransmission** | 255 × 2 | **511** |

The device then picks a random backoff value between 0 and CW (0-511), waits that many slot times, and tries again.

> **Answer: CW = 511 slots**
