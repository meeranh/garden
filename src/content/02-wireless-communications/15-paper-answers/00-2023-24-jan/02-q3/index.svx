## (3)(a) 6G Standardization Process

> Discuss the standardisation process for getting 6G into the market. *(6 marks)*

> *Learn more: [6G Standardization](/wireless-communications/5g/6g-standardization)*

---

Every cellular generation follows a **three-phase process**:

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Vision & Requirements** | Years 1-3 | ITU-R defines targets |
| **Technology Development** | Years 3-7 | 3GPP writes specifications |
| **Deployment** | Years 7-10+ | Networks go live |

---

**Phase 1: ITU-R sets the vision**

ITU-R defines **IMT-2030** (the 6G requirements), specifying targets for speed, latency, and new capabilities.

**Phase 2: 3GPP writes the specs**

3GPP creates the actual technical specifications in **Releases** (Release 21-22 expected for 6G).

**Phase 3: Deployment**

Operators build networks, manufacturers create devices.

---

**6G Timeline:**

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2023 | ITU-R starts IMT-2030 framework |
| 2027 | Requirements finalized |
| 2030 | First 6G specifications |
| 2030-2035 | Commercial deployment |

## (3)(b) 5G Deployment Options

> Describe the 5G deployment options. *(4 marks)*

> *Learn more: [5G Deployment Options](/wireless-communications/5g/deployment-options)*

---

**Two main approaches:**

| Option | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **NSA** | Non-Standalone | 5G radio + **4G core** |
| **SA** | Standalone | 5G radio + **5G core** |

---

**NSA (Option 3):**
- Uses existing 4G infrastructure
- 5G provides fast data, 4G handles control
- Faster and cheaper to deploy
- *Limited 5G features*

**SA (Option 2):**
- Completely new 5G network
- Full 5G capabilities (network slicing, ultra-low latency)
- More expensive, takes longer
- *The end goal*

> **Migration path:** Option 1 (4G) → Option 3 (NSA) → Option 2 (SA)

**Core Network Functions:**

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **gNB** | 5G base station, connects UE to core via radio link |
| **AMF** | First point of contact, handles registration and mobility |
| **AUSF** | Authenticates the user (verifies identity) |
| **SMF** | Sets up data sessions, assigns IP addresses |
| **UDM** | Stores subscription data (who you are, what you can access) |
| **PCF** | Applies policies (QoS rules, charging) |
| **UPF** | Forwards actual user data to the internet |
| **NSSF** | Selects the right network slice for the service |
