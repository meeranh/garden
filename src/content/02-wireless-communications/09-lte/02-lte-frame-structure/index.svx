title: LTE Frame Structure
---

LTE needs a way to organize **time** and **frequency** so millions of users can share the same spectrum. The **frame structure** is that organizational system.

Think of it like a train schedule. Every train (data packet) needs a specific time slot and platform (frequency). Without this structure, *chaos*.

---

## The Time Hierarchy

LTE divides time into a **nested hierarchy**. Each level zooms in *further*.

::frame-hierarchy

---

### Radio Frame: The Big Picture

The **radio frame** is the largest time unit:

> **1 Radio Frame = 10 ms**

This 10 ms window repeats *forever*. Everything in LTE is synchronized to this heartbeat.

---

### Subframes: Dividing the Frame

Each radio frame contains **10 subframes**:

| Unit | Duration | Count per Frame |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Radio Frame | 10 ms | 1 |
| Subframe | **1 ms** | 10 |

Each subframe is the **basic scheduling unit**. The network decides *what to send* in each 1 ms subframe.

---

### Time-Slots: Further Division

Each subframe splits into **2 time-slots**:

| Unit | Duration | Count per Subframe |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| Subframe | 1 ms | 1 |
| Time-slot | **0.5 ms** | 2 |

So one radio frame has **20 time-slots** total.

---

### OFDM Symbols: The Atomic Unit

Each time-slot contains **7 OFDM symbols** (with normal cyclic prefix):

| Unit | Duration | Count per Slot |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Time-slot | 0.5 ms | 1 |
| OFDM Symbol | ~71.4 μs | **7** |

Why 7? It comes from the math:
- Subcarrier spacing = 15 kHz
- Symbol duration = 1/15000 = 66.7 μs
- Add cyclic prefix time, and 7 symbols fit in 0.5 ms

---

## Cyclic Prefix: The Guard Time

*Remember* the **cyclic prefix** from OFDM? It's the guard time that prevents inter-symbol interference from multipath.

LTE offers **two options**:

::cyclic-prefix

---

### Normal Cyclic Prefix

- **CP duration:** ~5.2 μs (first symbol) / ~4.7 μs (others)
- **Symbols per slot:** 7
- **Use case:** Most deployments, small to medium cells

The short guard time means *more symbols* fit in each slot, giving you *higher throughput*.

---

### Extended Cyclic Prefix

- **CP duration:** ~16.7 μs
- **Symbols per slot:** 6
- **Use case:** Large cells, mountainous terrain, high multipath environments

The longer guard time *wastes* more capacity but provides *better protection* against multipath delay spread.

> **Rule of thumb:** Normal CP handles delay spreads up to ~5 μs. Extended CP handles up to ~17 μs.

---

## The Frequency Dimension

Now the *other* axis. LTE uses OFDM with a fixed **subcarrier spacing**:

> **Subcarrier spacing = 15 kHz**

The total bandwidth determines how many subcarriers you get:

| Bandwidth | Usable Subcarriers |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1.4 MHz | 72 |
| 5 MHz | 300 |
| 10 MHz | 600 |
| 20 MHz | 1200 |

---

## Resource Block: The Allocation Unit

Here's the *crucial* concept. LTE allocates resources in 2D chunks called **Resource Blocks (RB)**.

::resource-block

---

### What's in a Resource Block?

A **Resource Block** combines time and frequency:

> **1 RB = 12 subcarriers × 7 OFDM symbols**

Breaking that down:
- **12 subcarriers** × 15 kHz = **180 kHz** bandwidth
- **7 symbols** = **1 time-slot** = 0.5 ms duration
- **84 Resource Elements** total (12 × 7)

---

### Resource Element: The Smallest Unit

A **Resource Element (RE)** is the atomic unit:

> **1 RE = 1 subcarrier × 1 OFDM symbol**

This is the *smallest addressable unit* in LTE. Each RE carries one modulation symbol (QPSK, 16-QAM, or 64-QAM).

---

### How Many Resource Blocks?

The number of RBs depends on your bandwidth:

| Bandwidth | Resource Blocks |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1.4 MHz | 6 RBs |
| 5 MHz | 25 RBs |
| 10 MHz | 50 RBs |
| 20 MHz | 100 RBs |

The scheduler assigns RBs to users *each subframe*. **More RBs = more capacity.**

---

## FDD vs TDD: Frame Types

LTE supports two **duplexing modes** that determine how uplink and downlink share the spectrum.

::fdd-vs-tdd

---

### Type 1: FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)

**FDD** uses **separate frequencies** for uplink and downlink:

- Uplink and downlink transmit *simultaneously*
- Requires **paired spectrum** (two frequency bands)
- All 10 subframes available for each direction
- **Most common** in LTE deployments

---

### Type 2: TDD (Time Division Duplex)

**TDD** uses the **same frequency** for both directions:

- Uplink and downlink *take turns* in time
- Uses **unpaired spectrum** (single frequency band)
- Some subframes for DL, some for UL, some special
- **Flexible** UL/DL ratio based on traffic patterns

---

### Which is Better?

| Aspect | FDD | TDD |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Spectrum | Paired (more expensive) | Unpaired |
| Latency | Lower (simultaneous) | Higher (waiting for turn) |
| Flexibility | Fixed UL/DL ratio | Adjustable ratio |
| Deployment | ~80% of LTE networks | ~20% of LTE networks |

**FDD dominates** because paired spectrum was *historically* more available and the constant bandwidth simplifies planning.

## Summary: Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Radio frame | 10 ms |
| Subframe | 1 ms |
| Time-slot | 0.5 ms |
| Symbols/slot (Normal CP) | 7 |
| Symbols/slot (Extended CP) | 6 |
| Subcarrier spacing | 15 kHz |
| Resource Block | 12 subcarriers × 7 symbols |
| RB bandwidth | 180 kHz |

> **The frame structure is LTE's universal clock.** Every device, every tower, every packet follows this timing. It's what makes coordinated multi-user access possible.
