title: VoLTE
---

LTE was designed for **data only**. *Everything* is IP packets.

So how do you make **voice calls**?

---

## The Old Way: Fall Back to 3G

When LTE first launched, phones had to **drop to 3G** to make calls.

> This is called **CSFB** (Circuit-Switched Fallback).

**Problems:**
- Takes **5-7 seconds** to switch networks
- You **lose LTE data** during the call
- What happens when carriers *shut down 3G*?

*CSFB was always a temporary fix.*

---

## The Solution: VoLTE

> **VoLTE** = Voice over LTE = Send voice as data packets.

Instead of falling back to 3G, just treat voice like *any other data*.

Your voice becomes **IP packets**, sent over LTE, just like a web page or video.

*No fallback. No switching. Just data.*

## Why VoLTE is Better

| | CSFB (Old) | VoLTE |
|--|-----------|-------|
| **Call setup** | 5-7 seconds | *Under 1 second* |
| **Voice quality** | Narrowband | *HD Voice* |
| **Data during call** | No | *Yes* |
| **Future-proof** | Dies with 3G | *Long-term* |

## QoS: Priority for Voice

Voice packets can't wait behind someone's Netflix stream.

LTE creates a **dedicated bearer** (*a priority lane*) for voice:
- **Guaranteed bandwidth**
- **Low latency**
- **No waiting**

> Voice gets **VIP treatment**.

*Think of it like a fast lane on a highway.*

---

## HD Voice

Old calls: **Narrowband** (300 - 3,400 Hz) - *sounds muffled*

VoLTE: **Wideband** (50 - 7,000 Hz) - *clear and rich*

> More frequencies = better sound quality.

*Like upgrading from AM radio to FM.*

## Summary

| Concept | Key Point |
|---------|-----------|
| **CSFB** | Fall back to 3G for calls (*old way*) |
| **VoLTE** | Voice as IP packets over LTE |
| **QoS** | Priority lane for voice packets |
| **HD Voice** | Better audio with wideband codec |

> **VoLTE = voice is just data, *with VIP treatment*.**
