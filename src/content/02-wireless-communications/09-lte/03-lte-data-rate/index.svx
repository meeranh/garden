title: LTE Data Rate Calculations
---

How fast can LTE *actually* send data? The answer comes down to **counting** and **multiplying**.

> **Core idea:** Count how many symbols you send per second, then figure out how many bits each symbol carries.

---

## The Building Blocks

These are **fixed constants** from the LTE specification:

| Component | Value | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Subcarriers per RB | 12 | Defined by 3GPP |
| Slots per subframe | 2 | Subframe = 1ms, Slot = 0.5ms |
| Subframes per second | 1000 | Subframe = 1ms |
| Symbols per slot | **7** (Normal CP) | *or 6 with Extended CP* |

> **Note:** Symbols per slot depends on the Cyclic Prefix. Normal CP = 7 symbols, Extended CP = 6 symbols.

And bandwidth determines how many Resource Blocks you have:

| Bandwidth | Resource Blocks |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5 MHz | 25 RBs |
| 10 MHz | 50 RBs |
| 15 MHz | 75 RBs |
| 20 MHz | 100 RBs |

---

## Step 1: Count Symbols Per Second

Every RB gives you 12 subcarriers × 7 symbols per slot. You get 2 slots per subframe, and 1000 subframes per second.

> **Symbols/sec = RBs × 12 × 7 × 2 × 1000**

**Example for 20 MHz:**

$$\text{Symbols/sec} = 100 \times 12 \times 7 \times 2 \times 1000 = 16,800,000$$

That's **16.8 million symbols** flying through the air every second.

---

## Step 2: Bits Per Symbol (Modulation)

Each symbol carries a certain number of bits, depending on the **modulation scheme**:

| Modulation | Bits/Symbol | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| QPSK | 2 | Poor signal, cell edge |
| 16-QAM | 4 | Medium signal |
| 32-QAM | 5 | Good signal |
| 64-QAM | 6 | Excellent signal, close to tower |

*Higher QAM packs more bits per symbol, but needs a cleaner signal to decode correctly.*

---

## Step 3: Raw Bit Rate

Multiply symbols by bits per symbol:

> **Raw bits/sec = Symbols/sec × bits/symbol**

**Example:** 20 MHz with 16-QAM:

$$\text{Raw rate} = 16,800,000 \times 4 = 67,200,000 \text{ bps} = 67.2 \text{ Mbps}$$

But this is the *theoretical maximum*. Real systems have overhead.

---

## Step 4: Apply Real-World Factors

Two things eat into your raw rate:

### Coding Rate

Error correction adds redundancy. A **2/3 coding rate** means for every 3 bits transmitted, only 2 are actual data.

$$\text{After coding} = \text{Raw rate} \times \frac{2}{3}$$

### Bandwidth Efficiency

Not all spectrum carries user data. Guard bands, control channels, and reference signals take up space. Typical efficiency is **90%**.

$$\text{Effective rate} = \text{After coding} \times 0.90$$

---

## Step 5: MIMO Multiplication

**MIMO** (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) sends multiple data streams *simultaneously* using multiple antennas.

| MIMO Config | Spatial Layers | Multiplier |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1×1 (SISO) | 1 | ×1 |
| 2×2 | 2 | ×2 |
| 4×4 | 4 | ×4 |
| 8×8 | 8 | ×8 |

> **Final throughput = Effective rate × MIMO layers**

*This is why MIMO is so powerful. It literally multiplies your capacity.*

---

## The Complete Formula

Putting it all together:

$$\text{Throughput} = \underbrace{\text{RBs} \times 12 \times 7 \times 2 \times 1000}_{\text{symbols/sec}} \times \underbrace{\text{bits/symbol}}_{\text{modulation}} \times \underbrace{\text{coding rate}}_{\text{e.g. } \frac{2}{3}} \times \underbrace{\text{efficiency}}_{\text{e.g. } 0.9} \times \underbrace{\text{MIMO layers}}_{\text{e.g. } 4}$$

## Worked Example 1

> Calculate the maximum achievable throughput of the FDD LTE system in downlink under the following assumptions:
> - Normal Cyclic Prefix (CP), 10 MHz Bandwidth, 16-QAM Modulation, 4×4 MIMO
>
> *Hint: In Normal CP, there are 7 symbols and 12 subcarriers in a slot of 0.5 ms, 10 MHz contains 50 Resource Blocks, one modulation symbol carries 4 bits in 16-QAM.*

**Step 1:** Resource Blocks for 10 MHz = **50 RBs**

**Step 2:** Symbols per second:
$$50 \times 12 \times 7 \times 2 \times 1000 = 8,400,000$$

**Step 3:** Bits per symbol for 16-QAM = **4 bits**

**Step 4:** Raw bit rate:
$$8,400,000 \times 4 = 33,600,000 \text{ bps} = 33.6 \text{ Mbps}$$

**Step 5:** With 4×4 MIMO:
$$33.6 \times 4 = \boxed{134.4 \text{ Mbps}}$$

*No coding rate or efficiency given, so we use raw throughput.*

## Worked Example 2

> For an LTE release 8 system, consider an FDD system configured to use **20 MHz** of spectrum. Consider a Type 1 frame with normal Cyclic Prefix length of seven (7) symbols, and a transmission effective bandwidth of **90%**.
>
> (i) What is the effective downlink data rate using **16-QAM** and **2/3 encoding rate**? *(10 marks)*
>
> (ii) What is the impact on the system capacity when a **2×2 MIMO** antenna configuration is used? *(2 marks)*

**Part (i):**

**Step 1:** Resource Blocks for 20 MHz = **100 RBs**

**Step 2:** Symbols per second:
$$100 \times 12 \times 7 \times 2 \times 1000 = 16,800,000$$

**Step 3:** Bits per symbol for 16-QAM = **4 bits**

**Step 4:** Raw bit rate:
$$16,800,000 \times 4 = 67,200,000 \text{ bps} = 67.2 \text{ Mbps}$$

**Step 5:** Apply coding rate:
$$67.2 \times \frac{2}{3} = 44.8 \text{ Mbps}$$

**Step 6:** Apply bandwidth efficiency:
$$44.8 \times 0.9 = \boxed{40.32 \text{ Mbps}}$$

**Part (ii):**

With 2×2 MIMO, we get 2 spatial layers, so capacity doubles:
$$40.32 \times 2 = \boxed{80.64 \text{ Mbps}}$$

>
> (ii) What is the impact on the system capacity when an **8×8 MIMO** antenna configuration is used? *(2 marks)*

**Part (i):**

**Step 2:** Symbols per second:
$$100 \times 12 \times 7 \times 2 \times 1000 = 16,800,000$$

**Step 3:** Bits per symbol for 32-QAM = **5 bits**

**Step 4:** Raw bit rate:
$$16,800,000 \times 5 = 84,000,000 \text{ bps} = 84 \text{ Mbps}$$

**Step 5:** Apply coding rate:
$$84 \times \frac{2}{3} = 56 \text{ Mbps}$$

**Step 6:** Apply bandwidth efficiency:
$$56 \times 0.9 = \boxed{50.4 \text{ Mbps}}$$

**Part (ii):**

With 8×8 MIMO, we get 8 spatial layers:
$$50.4 \times 8 = \boxed{403.2 \text{ Mbps}}$$
