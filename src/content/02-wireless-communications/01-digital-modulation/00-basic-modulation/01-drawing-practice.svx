## Exam Skill: Drawing Modulation Waveforms

A common exam question: *"Draw the ASK, FSK, and PSK waveforms for the bit sequence `01001011`"*

This page teaches you how to draw each waveform step by step.

## Drawing ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)

**Rule:** Change the **amplitude** based on the bit value.

- **1** = High amplitude (full sine wave)
- **0** = Low amplitude (small or no wave)

**Steps to draw ASK:**

1. Draw your bit sequence in boxes along the top
2. Mark vertical lines at each bit boundary
3. For each bit:
   - If **1**: draw a full-height sine wave
   - If **0**: draw a small (or flat) wave
4. Keep the frequency constant throughout

## Drawing FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)

**Rule:** Change the **frequency** based on the bit value.

- **1** = High frequency (more cycles per bit)
- **0** = Low frequency (fewer cycles per bit)

**Steps to draw FSK:**

1. Draw your bit sequence in boxes along the top
2. Mark vertical lines at each bit boundary
3. For each bit:
   - If **1**: draw many cycles (squished waves)
   - If **0**: draw fewer cycles (stretched waves)
4. Keep the amplitude constant throughout

## Drawing BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)

**Rule:** Change the **phase** based on the bit value.

- **0** = Reference phase (0°)
- **1** = Inverted phase (180°)

**Steps to draw BPSK:**

1. Draw your bit sequence in boxes along the top
2. Mark vertical lines at each bit boundary
3. For each bit:
   - If **0**: continue the wave normally
   - If **1**: flip the wave (invert it)
4. Mark phase changes at boundaries where bit value changes

> **Key insight:** In BPSK, the wave "flips" whenever you transition between 0 and 1.

## Quick Reference

| Modulation | What changes? | 0 | 1 |
|------------|---------------|---|---|
| **ASK** | Amplitude | Low/none | High |
| **FSK** | Frequency | Low freq | High freq |
| **BPSK** | Phase | 0° | 180° (inverted) |

## Practice

Try drawing waveforms for these sequences:

1. `10110010`
2. `01010101`
3. `11100011`

For each sequence, draw all three: ASK, FSK, and BPSK.
