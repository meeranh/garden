## BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)

**Rule:** Change the **phase** based on the bit value.

- **0** = Reference phase (0°)
- **1** = Inverted phase (180°)

## Steps to Draw

1. Draw your bit sequence in boxes along the top
2. Mark vertical lines at each bit boundary
3. For each bit:
   - If **0**: continue the wave normally
   - If **1**: flip the wave (invert it)
4. Mark phase changes at boundaries where bit value changes

## Quick Reference

| Bit | Phase |
|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0° (normal) |
| 1 | 180° (inverted) |

> **Key insight:** The wave "flips" whenever you transition between 0 and 1.
