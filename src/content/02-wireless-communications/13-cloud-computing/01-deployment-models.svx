title: Cloud Deployment Models
---

## The Question

*Where is the cloud infrastructure located and who can use it?*

Four deployment models answer this differently.

---

## Public Cloud

The cloud provider owns everything. **Anyone** can use it by paying.

- **Who owns it:** Cloud provider (Amazon, Google, Microsoft)
- **Who uses it:** Anyone who pays
- **Examples:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Cheap (pay-per-use) | Less control |
| No maintenance | Shared with others |
| Scales easily | Data on someone else's servers |

> *Like renting an apartment - you don't own the building, but it's cheap and easy.*

---

## Private Cloud

Your organization owns and operates the cloud. **Only your people** can use it.

- **Who owns it:** Your organization
- **Who uses it:** Only your organization
- **Examples:** Company's own data center running cloud software

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Full control | Expensive |
| More secure | You handle maintenance |
| Customizable | Need in-house expertise |

> *Like owning a house - full control, but you pay for everything.*

---

## Hybrid Cloud

**Mix of public and private.** Keep sensitive stuff private, use public for the rest.

- **How it works:** Connect private cloud to public cloud
- **Example:** Bank keeps customer data on private cloud, uses AWS for marketing website

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Best of both worlds | Complex to manage |
| Security where needed | Integration challenges |
| Cost savings elsewhere | Need expertise in both |

> *Like owning a house but renting a vacation property - use each where it makes sense.*

---

## Community Cloud

Shared by several organizations with **common concerns** (same industry, same regulations).

- **Who owns it:** Shared by the community or a third party
- **Who uses it:** Only community members
- **Examples:** Government agencies sharing a cloud, hospitals sharing a healthcare cloud

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Shared costs | Still shared |
| Meets industry regulations | Less control than private |
| Common security standards | Limited to community needs |

> *Like a co-op building - shared ownership among people with similar needs.*

## Comparison

| Model | Owned By | Used By | Cost | Control |
|-------|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Public** | Provider | Anyone | Low | Low |
| **Private** | Your org | Your org | High | High |
| **Hybrid** | Mixed | Your org | Medium | Medium |
| **Community** | Shared | Community | Medium | Medium |

---

## Choosing a Model

- **Public** - Startups, cost-sensitive, non-sensitive data
- **Private** - Banks, healthcare, government, high security needs
- **Hybrid** - Large enterprises with mixed requirements
- **Community** - Organizations in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government)
