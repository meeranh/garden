title: Cloud Delivery Models
---

## The Question

*How much does the cloud provider manage for you?*

Three delivery models offer different levels of management.

## The Pizza Analogy

| Model | Pizza Equivalent |
|-------|------------------|
| **On-Premises** | Make pizza at home from scratch |
| **IaaS** | Buy frozen pizza base, add your toppings |
| **PaaS** | Order pizza, choose your toppings |
| **SaaS** | Eat at restaurant, everything done for you |

---

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Provider gives you **virtual machines**. You install and manage everything on top.

**Provider gives you:**
- Servers (virtual machines)
- Storage
- Networking

**You manage:**
- Operating system
- Middleware
- Applications
- Data

**Examples:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs

> *"Here's a computer in the cloud. Do whatever you want with it."*

---

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Provider gives you a **platform to run your code**. Just deploy your app.

**Provider gives you:**
- Everything in IaaS, plus...
- Operating system
- Middleware
- Runtime environment

**You manage:**
- Your application code
- Your data

**Examples:** Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

> *"Just give us your code. We'll run it."*

---

## SaaS (Software as a Service)

Provider gives you **ready-to-use software**. Just log in and use it.

**Provider gives you:**
- Everything. The complete application.

**You manage:**
- Nothing (just your content)

**Examples:** Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Netflix

> *"Just use it. We handle everything."*

## Who Manages What?

| Layer | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|-------|------|------|------|
| **Application** | You | You | Provider |
| **Data** | You | You | Provider |
| **Runtime** | You | Provider | Provider |
| **Middleware** | You | Provider | Provider |
| **OS** | You | Provider | Provider |
| **Virtualization** | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| **Servers** | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| **Storage** | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| **Networking** | Provider | Provider | Provider |

## Comparison

| Model | You Manage | Provider Manages | Example |
|-------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **IaaS** | OS, apps, data | Infrastructure | AWS EC2 |
| **PaaS** | Apps, data | Infrastructure + platform | Google App Engine |
| **SaaS** | Just use it | Everything | Microsoft 365 |

## The Trade-off

$$
\text{IaaS} \xrightarrow{\text{more managed}} \text{PaaS} \xrightarrow{\text{more managed}} \text{SaaS}
$$

| | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|--|------|------|------|
| **Control** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Effort** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Cost** | Variable | Variable | Subscription |

---

## When to Use Each

- **IaaS** - Need full control, custom configurations, legacy apps
- **PaaS** - Developers who just want to deploy code quickly
- **SaaS** - End users who need ready-made software
