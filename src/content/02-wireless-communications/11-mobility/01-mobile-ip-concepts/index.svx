## The Problem

Your phone has an IP address. When you move from one network to another, you get a *new* IP address.

But any ongoing connections (video call, download) **break**. The other side is still sending packets to your *old* address.

---

## The Solution: Two Addresses

Mobile IP gives your device **two addresses**:

::two-addresses

---

### Home Address (HA)

Your **permanent** address. *Never changes.*

This is what other devices use to reach you. Think of it like your permanent mailing address.

---

### Care-of Address (CoA)

Your **temporary** address. *Changes every time you move.*

This is where you *actually* are right now. Think of it like your hotel address when traveling.

---

## How It Works

Someone sends a packet to your Home Address. But you're not home.

Your **Home Agent** (a router at your home network) knows you've moved. It forwards the packet to your current Care-of Address.

You receive it wherever you are.

## The Mail Analogy

Imagine you're traveling but still want to receive mail:

- **Home Address** is like your permanent home address, where people send letters
- **Care-of Address** is like the hotel you're staying at right now
- **Home Agent** is like a family member at home who forwards your mail to your hotel

> The sender doesn't need to know you moved. They keep sending to your home address, and it gets forwarded to wherever you are.

## Why This Matters

| Without Mobile IP | With Mobile IP |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Connection breaks when you move | Connection stays alive |
| Apps need to reconnect | Seamless handover |
| Downloads restart | Downloads continue |

> **Mobile IP = Location transparency.** *Move anywhere, keep the same address.*
