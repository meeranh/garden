## The Problem

Your phone can connect to **different networks**: WiFi, LTE, WiMAX, etc.

Each network has its own way of doing things. When you want to switch from WiFi to LTE, the upper layers (like Mobile IP) need to know what's happening.

But each network speaks a **different language**. How do the upper layers understand all of them?

---

## The Solution: MIH Function

**MIH** (Media Independent Handover) sits in the middle and **translates**.

It provides a **common interface** that works the same way regardless of which network you're using.

## How It Works

Upper layers ask MIH questions like:
- *"What's the signal like?"*
- *"Is there a better network nearby?"*

MIH asks the specific network and gives back a **standardized answer**.

> **MIH = One interface to rule them all**

---

## Three Types of Services

MIH provides three services:

1. **Event Services** - Network tells upper layers something happened
2. **Command Services** - Upper layers tell network to do something
3. **Information Services** - Database of available networks

---

## Event Services

*"Something happened, let me tell you about it"*

Events flow **upward** from the network to upper layers.

| Event | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Link_Detected** | "I found a new network nearby" |
| **Link_Up** | "Connection established" |
| **Link_Down** | "Connection lost" |
| **Link_Going_Down** | "Connection is *about to* drop" |
| **Link_Parameters_Report** | "Here's the current signal quality" |

---

### Link_Going_Down is Powerful

This event **predicts** that the connection will drop soon.

It warns you *before* you lose connection, so you can prepare a handover. This is exactly what FMIPv6 needs!

> *"I'm about to lose signal. Start preparing now!"*

---

## Command Services

*"Do this for me"*

Commands flow **downward** from upper layers to the network.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Link_Get_Parameters** | "Tell me the current signal strength" |
| **Link_Configure_Thresholds** | "Warn me when signal drops below X" |
| **Link_Actions** | "Connect/disconnect from this network" |

---

### Handover Queries

Two special commands help with handover decisions:

- **MIH_Net_HO_Candidate_Query** - Network asks: *"Where can this device go?"*
- **MIH_MN_HO_Candidate_Query** - Device asks: *"What networks are available?"*

These help both the network and device find the best handover target.

---

## Information Services

*"What options do I have?"*

This is like a **database** of available networks and their properties:

- What networks exist nearby?
- What are their capabilities?
- What's the cost of using each one?

The device queries this to make **smart decisions** about which network to switch to.

---

## What MIH Does NOT Do

MIH doesn't do the handover itself.

It just provides **information** and **control**. The actual handover is still done by Mobile IP or other protocols.

> Think of MIH as a **translator** and **messenger** between network layers and upper layers.

---

## Why MIH Matters

**Without MIH**, Mobile IP would need separate code for:
- How to detect WiFi signal drop
- How to detect LTE signal drop
- How to detect WiMAX signal drop
- etc.

**With MIH**, Mobile IP just listens for `Link_Going_Down` and it works for **all** networks.

## Summary

### Event Services (Network → Upper Layers)

| Event | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **MIH_Link_Detected** | New network found nearby |
| **MIH_Link_Up** | Connection established |
| **MIH_Link_Down** | Connection lost |
| **MIH_Link_Going_Down** | Connection about to drop |
| **MIH_Link_Parameters_Report** | Signal quality update |

### Command Services (Upper Layers → Network)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **MIH_Link_Get_Parameters** | Get current signal strength |
| **MIH_Link_Configure_Thresholds** | Set warning thresholds |
| **MIH_Link_Actions** | Connect/disconnect |
| **MIH_Net_HO_Candidate_Query** | Network asks for handover targets |
| **MIH_MN_HO_Candidate_Query** | Device asks for available networks |

> **MIH provides a common language for heterogeneous networks.**
