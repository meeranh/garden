title: 64-bit Block, 56-bit Key
---

## Block Cipher

DES is a **block cipher**.

It doesn't encrypt your whole message at once. It chops it into fixed-size pieces called **blocks**.

Each block is exactly **64 bits** (8 bytes).

---

Think of it like a machine that only processes one chunk at a time:

- Your message gets split into 64-bit pieces
- Each piece goes through the cipher separately
- The encrypted pieces are joined back together

---

## Why 64 bits?

In the 1970s, 64 bits was a practical tradeoff:

- **Small enough** to process quickly on slow hardware
- **Large enough** to hide patterns within each block

> Modern ciphers like AES use **128-bit blocks** because computers are faster now.

---

## The Key

The key is the secret that controls *how* the encryption scrambles your data.

- Same key encrypts
- Same key decrypts
- Lose the key, lose your data

---

## The 56-bit Controversy

Here's where it gets interesting.

The DES key is technically **64 bits** long.

But only **56 bits** are actually used for encryption.

---

What happened to the other 8 bits?

---

## Parity Bits

Every 8th bit is a **parity bit** used for error checking, not encryption.

---

Each byte contributes **7 bits** to the actual key.

$$8 \text{ bytes} \times 7 \text{ bits} = 56 \text{ key bits}$$

> The parity bits detect transmission errors. They add *zero* security.

---

## Why 56 Bits Matters

56 bits means there are $2^{56}$ possible keys.

That's about **72 quadrillion** combinations:

$$72,057,594,037,927,936$$

Sounds impossible to crack, right?

## The Math That Killed DES

In 1977, trying all keys would take centuries.

But computers get faster. *Exponentially* faster.

::@crypto/symmetric/des/key-cracking

---

**Moore's Law** roughly states that computing power doubles every two years.

What takes centuries today takes decades in 10 years, years in 20, days in 30...

> 56 bits bought about 20 years. Then it collapsed.

---

## The Suspicion

IBM's original Lucifer cipher used a **128-bit key**.

The NSA made them cut it to **56 bits**.

---

Some believe the NSA wanted a key size that was:

- **Strong enough** for businesses to trust
- **Weak enough** for NSA supercomputers to crack

> We still don't know for sure.

---

56 bits was the weakness that killed DES.

> Today, **128 bits** is the minimum. 256 is preferred.
