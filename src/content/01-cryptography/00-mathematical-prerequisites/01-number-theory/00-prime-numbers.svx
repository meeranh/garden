## What's a Prime?

A **prime number** is a number that can only be divided evenly by **1 and itself**.

**Is 7 prime?**

Try to divide it:

- $7 \div 2$ = 3.5 (not even)
- $7 \div 3$ = 2.33... (not even)
- $7 \div 4$ = 1.75 (not even)
- $7 \div 5$ = 1.4 (not even)
- $7 \div 6$ = 1.16... (not even)

Nothing works except 1 and 7. **Yes, 7 is prime.**

---

**Is 12 prime?**

- $12 \div 2$ = 6 (even!)

We found a divisor. **No, 12 is not prime.**

## The First Few Primes

$$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31...$$

Some patterns:

- **2 is the only even prime.** Every other even number is divisible by 2.
- **1 is not prime.** By definition, primes must be greater than 1.
- **Primes get sparser** as numbers get bigger, but they never stop.

## Composite Numbers

Numbers that *aren't* prime are called **composite**. They can be broken into smaller factors.

| Number | Prime or Composite? | Why |
|--------|---------------------|-----|
| 7 | Prime | Only 1 × 7 |
| 12 | Composite | 2 × 6, 3 × 4 |
| 23 | Prime | Only 1 × 23 |
| 15 | Composite | 3 × 5 |

## Prime Factorization

Every composite number can be written as a product of primes.

- $12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3$
- $30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$
- $100 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 5$

> This breakdown is **unique**. There's only one way to factor a number into primes.
