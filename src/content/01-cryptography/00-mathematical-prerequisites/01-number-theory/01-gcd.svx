title: Greatest Common Divisor
---

## What is GCD?

Sometimes two numbers share factors.

- 12 and 18 are both divisible by 2
- They're also both divisible by 3
- And both divisible by 6

The **Greatest Common Divisor** is the *biggest* number that divides both evenly.

> GCD(12, 18) = 6

## Finding GCD: The Prime Factor Method

Here's the idea: break each number into primes, see what they share.

---

**Example:** GCD(12, 18)

First, find the prime factorization of each:

$$12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3$$

$$18 = 2 \times 3 \times 3$$

What's common? One 2 and one 3. Multiply them:

$$\gcd = 2 \times 3 = 6$$

::gcd-factors

---

**Another example:** GCD(30, 45)

$$30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$$

$$45 = 3 \times 3 \times 5$$

What's common? One 3 and one 5. Multiply them:

$$\gcd = 3 \times 5 = 15$$

## The Problem with Prime Factorization

This method works, but there's a catch.

> Factoring big numbers is *hard*.

For small numbers like 12 or 45, it's easy. But what about GCD(1,234,567 and 7,654,321)?

Finding the prime factors of those numbers would take a while.

We need a faster method.

## The Euclidean Algorithm

This 2,300-year-old algorithm finds the GCD *without* factoring.

The idea is simple: **repeatedly divide and keep the remainder**.

---

**The steps:**

1. Divide the bigger number by the smaller
2. Keep the remainder
3. Replace the bigger number with the smaller, and the smaller with the remainder
4. Repeat until the remainder is 0

> When you hit 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

---

**Example:** GCD(48, 18)

::gcd-euclidean

Let's walk through it step by step.

---

**Step 1:** Divide 48 by 18

$$48 \div 18 = 2$$ (remainder 12)

Now we have a new pair: (18, 12)

---

**Step 2:** Divide 18 by 12

$$18 \div 12 = 1$$ (remainder 6)

New pair: (12, 6)

---

**Step 3:** Divide 12 by 6

$$12 \div 6 = 2$$ (remainder 0)

We hit 0. The last non-zero remainder was **6**.

> GCD(48, 18) = **6**

---

## Connection to Coprime

Remember **coprime** numbers? Two numbers are coprime when they share *no* common factors.

In GCD terms:

> Two numbers are **coprime** when their GCD is 1.

---

$$\gcd(8, 15) = 1 \rightarrow \text{coprime}$$

$$\gcd(12, 18) = 6 \rightarrow \text{not coprime}$$

---

**Why it makes sense:**

- GCD = 1 means the only number that divides both is 1
- That means no shared prime factors
- That's exactly what coprime means
