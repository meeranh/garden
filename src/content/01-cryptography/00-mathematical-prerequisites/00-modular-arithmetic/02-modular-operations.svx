title: Modular Operations
---

## The Core Idea

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication all work the same way:

> **Do the operation, then take mod.**

---

## Addition

$$(7 + 8) \mod 12 = 15 \mod 12 = 3$$

Clock intuition: 7 o'clock plus 8 hours lands on **3 o'clock**.

---

## Subtraction

$$(3 - 7) \mod 12 = -4 \mod 12 = 8$$

Clock intuition: 3 o'clock minus 7 hours, go **backwards** to **8 o'clock**.

---

**What about negative results?**

Mod always gives a result between $0$ and $n-1$, where $n$ is the modulus. Negative numbers aren't in that range.

The fix: **add the modulus until positive**.

---

Think about the clock. What's $-1 \mod 12$?

Go 1 step *backwards* from 0. You land on **11**.

So $-1 \mod 12 = 11$. We get there by computing $-1 + 12 = 11$.

---

What about $-4 \mod 12$?

Go 4 steps backwards from 0: $0 \to 11 \to 10 \to 9 \to 8$.

So $-4 \mod 12 = 8$. Or just compute $-4 + 12 = 8$.

---

**More examples:**

| Expression | Calculation | Result |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| $-3 \mod 7$ | $-3 + 7$ | **4** |
| $-5 \mod 8$ | $-5 + 8$ | **3** |
| $-13 \mod 5$ | $-13 + 5 + 5 + 5$ | **2** |

If one addition isn't enough, keep adding until you're positive.

---

## Multiplication

$$(5 \times 7) \mod 12 = 35 \mod 12 = 11$$

Same pattern: multiply, then take the remainder.

---

## The Key Insight

Here's something important:

> Numbers with the **same remainder** are **interchangeable**.

What does this mean? Since $17 \mod 12 = 5$, we can swap 17 for 5 in any mod 12 calculation.

They're the same position on the clock. They behave identically.

---

## The Shortcut

Since we can swap any number for its remainder, we can **simplify before computing**.

Take $(17 \times 25) \mod 12$:

**The hard way:** $17 \times 25 = 425$, then $425 \mod 12 = 5$

**The easy way:** $17 \mod 12 = 5$ and $25 \mod 12 = 1$. Now $5 \times 1 = 5$.

Same answer. Much smaller numbers.

---

This works for addition too.

$(56 + 37) \mod 10$

**The hard way:** $56 + 37 = 93$, then $93 \mod 10 = 3$

**The easy way:** $56 \mod 10 = 6$ and $37 \mod 10 = 7$. Now $6 + 7 = 13$, and $13 \mod 10 = 3$.

---

## Why This Matters

In cryptography, we compute things like:

$$M^{65537} \mod n$$

If you computed $M^{65537}$ first, you'd get a number with **millions of digits**.

Instead, take mod after *each* multiplication. The numbers stay small throughout, and you get the same answer.
