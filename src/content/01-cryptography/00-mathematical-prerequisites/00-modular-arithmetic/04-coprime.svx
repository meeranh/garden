## Dividing Evenly

Some divisions come out clean:

$$12 \div 3 = 4$$

No remainder. We say **3 divides 12 evenly**.

---

Some don't:

$$12 \div 5 = 2 \text{ remainder } 2$$

5 does *not* divide 12 evenly.

---

## Factors

A **factor** of a number is anything that divides it evenly.

---

**What are the factors of 12?**

- $12 \div 1 = 12$ ✓
- $12 \div 2 = 6$ ✓
- $12 \div 3 = 4$ ✓
- $12 \div 4 = 3$ ✓
- $12 \div 6 = 2$ ✓
- $12 \div 12 = 1$ ✓

> **Factors of 12:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

## Common Factors

Sometimes two numbers share factors.

---

**Factors of 8:** 1, 2, 4, 8

**Factors of 12:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

What do they have in common? **1, 2, and 4**.

> These are called **common factors**.

---

## Coprime

Two numbers are **coprime** if their only common factor is 1.

---

**Are 8 and 15 coprime?**

Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15

Common factors: just **1**.

> 8 and 15 are **coprime**.

---

**Are 8 and 12 coprime?**

Common factors: 1, 2, 4.

More than just 1.

> 8 and 12 are **not coprime**.

## The Connection to Modular Inverse

Remember: the modular inverse of $a$ mod $n$ is a number $b$ where:

$$(a \times b) \mod n = 1$$

---

**Here's the key:**

> A modular inverse exists **only if** $a$ and $n$ are coprime.

---

If they share a factor, you can never reach 1. The inverse doesn't exist.

If they're coprime, you can always find an inverse.
