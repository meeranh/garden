## What's a Factor?

A **factor** is a number that fits into another number evenly.

---

To find the factors of 12, find all the ways to multiply two numbers to get 12:

- $12 = 1 \times 12$
- $12 = 2 \times 6$
- $12 = 3 \times 4$

> **Factors of 12:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

---

## Shared Factors

Two numbers **share a factor** if the same number divides both evenly.

---

**Do 8 and 12 share any factors?**

Factors of 8: 1, **2**, **4**, 8

Factors of 12: 1, **2**, 3, **4**, 6, 12

> **Shared factors:** 1, 2, 4

---

## Coprime

Two numbers are **coprime** if they share **no factors except 1**.

---

| Numbers | Shared factors | Coprime? |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| 8 and 12 | 1, 2, 4 | **No** |
| 9 and 14 | 1 only | **Yes** |
| 4 and 8 | 1, 2, 4 | **No** |
| 3 and 7 | 1 only | **Yes** |

## Why Coprime Matters

Remember modular inverses? Not every number has one.

> **The rule:** $a$ has an inverse mod $n$ **only if** $a$ and $n$ are coprime.

---

**Why?**

Take **4 mod 8**. They share factor 4.

Multiply 4 by anything: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20... every result is divisible by 4.

Take mod 8: you get 4, 0, 4, 0, 4... only **0 and 4**. Never 1.

> Shared factor → results stuck in multiples → can't reach 1 → **no inverse**.

---

**But 3 and 7 are coprime...**

- $3 \times 5 = 15$
- $15 \mod 7 = 1$ ✓

We can reach 1. The inverse exists.

> When numbers are coprime, you *can* reach 1. The inverse exists.

In RSA, certain numbers *must* be coprime for the math to work. We'll see exactly which ones when we get there.

> **Coprime isn't just theory.** It's what makes RSA possible.
