title: Modular Inverse
---

## The Problem

In regular math, every number has an inverse:

$$5 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1$$

The inverse of 5 is $\frac{1}{5}$. Multiply them, you get 1.

---

But in modular arithmetic, **there are no fractions**. Everything is whole numbers.

So how do we "undo" multiplication?

## The Modular Inverse

The **modular inverse** of $a$ (mod $n$) is a number $b$ such that:

$$(a \times b) \mod n = 1$$

> Multiply $a$ and $b$, take mod $n$, get **1**.

## Finding an Inverse

**Example:** What's the inverse of 3 mod 7?

We need a number that, when multiplied by 3, gives remainder 1.

Let's try them all:

| Try | Calculation | Result mod 7 | Is it 1? |
|-----|-------------|--------------|----------|
| $3 \times 1$ | $3$ | $3$ | ✗ |
| $3 \times 2$ | $6$ | $6$ | ✗ |
| $3 \times 3$ | $9$ | $2$ | ✗ |
| $3 \times 4$ | $12$ | $5$ | ✗ |
| $3 \times 5$ | $15$ | $1$ | ✓ |

**Found it.** The inverse of 3 mod 7 is **5**.

---

We write this as:

$$3^{-1} \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$$

Check: $3 \times 5 = 15$, and $15 \mod 7 = 1$. ✓

## Why Do We Care?

In regular math, division is just multiplying by the inverse:

$$a \div b = a \times \frac{1}{b}$$

Same in modular arithmetic. To "divide" by $b$, multiply by $b$'s inverse.

In RSA encryption, the private key $d$ is the modular inverse of the public exponent $e$.

Finding that inverse is how you generate the key pair.
