## What is Bit Manipulation?

Operating on individual bits inside binary numbers.

You've already seen XOR. Here are the other common operations.

---

## AND

Both bits must be 1 to get 1.

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \land B$ |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

> Only 1 AND 1 gives 1. Everything else is 0.

---

**Example:**

$$1011 \land 1100 = 1000$$

Compare each column. Both 1? Keep it. Otherwise, 0.

---

## OR

Either bit being 1 gives 1.

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \lor B$ |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

> Only 0 OR 0 gives 0. Everything else is 1.

---

**Example:**

$$1011 \lor 1100 = 1111$$

---

## NOT

Flip every bit.

$$\lnot 1011 = 0100$$

1 becomes 0. 0 becomes 1.

---

## Left Shift

Move all bits to the left. Fill the right with 0.

$$1011 \ll 1 = 10110$$

$$1011 \ll 2 = 101100$$

> Each left shift **multiplies by 2**.

---

## Right Shift

Move all bits to the right. Bits on the right fall off.

$$1011 \gg 1 = 101$$

$$1011 \gg 2 = 10$$

> Each right shift **divides by 2** (drops remainder).

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Symbol | What it does |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| AND | $\land$ | 1 only if both are 1 |
| OR | $\lor$ | 1 if either is 1 |
| XOR | $\oplus$ | 1 if different |
| NOT | $\lnot$ | Flip all bits |
| Left shift | $\ll$ | Multiply by 2 |
| Right shift | $\gg$ | Divide by 2 |
