title: Secret Sharing

## The Single Point of Failure

You have a secret: a master key, a password, nuclear launch codes.

**One person holds it.** What could go wrong?

- They **die** unexpectedly
- They **get compromised**
- They **go rogue**
- They simply **forget**

> A secret held by one person is a single point of failure.

---

## The Solution: Split It

**Secret sharing** splits a secret into multiple **shares** distributed among different people.

- No single person can reconstruct the secret alone
- A **minimum number** must cooperate (the *threshold*)
- Below that minimum, *nothing* is revealed

::@crypto/steganography/shamir/secret-sharing-roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Dealer** | Holds original secret, builds polynomial, distributes shares |
| **Players** | Each holds one share, must cooperate to reconstruct |
| **Combiner** | Collects $t$ shares, performs interpolation, recovers secret |

The combiner could be one of the players, or a separate trusted party.

---

## Threshold Schemes: (t, n)

A **(t, n) threshold scheme** splits a secret into $n$ shares such that:

- Any **$t$ or more** shares can reconstruct the secret
- **Fewer than $t$** shares reveal *absolutely nothing*

**Example:** A **(3, 5) scheme**:

- 5 people each get one share
- Any 3 can recover the secret
- Any 2 learn **zero** information

> $t$ = threshold (minimum needed), $n$ = total shares

---

## The Naive Approach Fails

Why not just split the secret into pieces?

| Secret | Split into |
|--------|-----------|
| `SECRETKEY` | `SECR` + `ETKE` + `Y` |

**The problem:** Each piece reveals *partial information*.

With `SECR`, you've already narrowed down possibilities. That's a leak.

> True secret sharing must be **all-or-nothing**. Below threshold = zero information. Not "less" information.

## Shamir's Secret Sharing

Adi Shamir (the **S** in RSA) invented this in 1979.

**The key insight:** A polynomial of degree $t-1$ is uniquely determined by exactly $t$ points.

| Polynomial | Degree | Points needed |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Line | 1 | 2 |
| Parabola | 2 | 3 |
| Cubic | 3 | 4 |
| Degree $t-1$ | $t-1$ | $t$ |

With fewer points, *infinitely many* polynomials fit. You learn nothing about which one is correct.

## The Setup

**Dealer** wants to share secret $S$ with:

- **Threshold:** $t$ (minimum shares needed)
- **Players:** $n$ (total shares)

The dealer will build a polynomial where the **secret is hidden at $f(0)$**.

---

## Step 1: Build a Random Polynomial

The dealer constructs:

$$f(x) = S + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots + a_{t-1} x^{t-1}$$

- **Constant term** = the secret $S$
- **Other coefficients** $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{t-1}$ = random values
- **Degree** = $t - 1$

> The secret sits at $f(0) = S$. The randomness hides everything else.

---

## Step 2: Generate Shares

The dealer evaluates the polynomial at $n$ different points:

| Player | Share |
|--------|-------|
| Player 1 | $(1, f(1))$ |
| Player 2 | $(2, f(2))$ |
| Player 3 | $(3, f(3))$ |
| ... | ... |
| Player $n$ | $(n, f(n))$ |

Each player receives **one point** on the polynomial.

## Step 3: Reconstruct the Secret

When $t$ players combine their shares:

1. They have $t$ points on a degree $t-1$ polynomial
2. Use **Lagrange interpolation** to recover the unique polynomial
3. Evaluate $f(0)$ to get the secret $S$

> With exactly $t$ points, there's exactly *one* polynomial that fits. The secret is determined.

## Why Fewer Shares Reveal Nothing

With only $t-1$ points on a degree $t-1$ polynomial:

**Infinitely many polynomials** pass through those points.

For *any* possible secret value $S$, there exists a valid polynomial with $f(0) = S$.

| Points | Possible secrets |
|--------|-----------------|
| $t$ points | Exactly 1 (determined) |
| $t-1$ points | Infinitely many (any value possible) |

> You can't even narrow down. The secret could literally be *anything*.

---

## Concrete Example: (2, 3) Scheme

**Secret:** $S = 42$

**Threshold:** $t = 2$

**Players:** $n = 3$

---

**Step 1:** Build a degree 1 polynomial (a line):

$$f(x) = 42 + 7x$$

The coefficient $7$ is chosen randomly.

---

**Step 2:** Generate shares:

| Player | Calculation | Share |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | $f(1) = 42 + 7(1)$ | $(1, 49)$ |
| 2 | $f(2) = 42 + 7(2)$ | $(2, 56)$ |
| 3 | $f(3) = 42 + 7(3)$ | $(3, 63)$ |

---

**Step 3:** Reconstruction

Any **2 players** can find the line through their points and compute $f(0) = 42$.

**1 player alone?** Infinitely many lines pass through one point. The secret could be *any* value.

---

## Information-Theoretic Security

This isn't "computationally hard to break." It's **impossible**.

With $t-1$ shares, every possible secret is equally consistent with your data. No amount of computing power helps.

> Unconditional security. Not based on assumptions. Mathematically absolute.

---

## Applications

| Use case | How secret sharing helps |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Key escrow** | Company recovery key split among executives. No single person can access alone. |
| **Cloud security** | Encryption key shared across servers. Compromise one, learn nothing. |
| **Cryptocurrency** | Multi-signature wallets. Require 3-of-5 holders to authorize. |
| **Nuclear launch** | Multiple officers must cooperate. No single person can act alone. |

---

## Key Insight

Secret sharing transforms a **single point of failure** into **distributed trust**.

The secret exists *nowhere* until enough parties cooperate. No single share, no single person, no single server holds the answer.

> The whole is recoverable. The parts are useless.
