## The Key Management Problem

In symmetric cryptography, every pair of users needs a unique shared key.

With 100 users, that's:

$$\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{100 \times 99}{2} = 4,950 \text{ keys}$$

With 1,000 users? Nearly **500,000 keys**.

> This doesn't scale. You can't securely distribute and manage that many keys.

## The KDC Solution

A **Key Distribution Center** is a trusted server that everyone shares a key with.

- Alice has a key with KDC: $K_A$
- Bob has a key with KDC: $K_B$
- 100 users need only **100 keys**, not 4,950

When Alice wants to talk to Bob, the KDC generates a fresh **session key** just for them.

## How It Works

1. Alice sends a request to KDC: *"I want to talk to Bob"*
2. KDC generates a fresh session key $K_S$
3. KDC encrypts $K_S$ with Alice's key: $E_{K_A}(K_S)$
4. KDC encrypts $K_S$ with Bob's key: $E_{K_B}(K_S)$
5. Both receive the same session key
6. Alice and Bob communicate using $K_S$

> The session key is **temporary**. A new one is generated for each conversation.

---

## The Trust Problem

The KDC knows **every session key**. It can read any conversation.

You must trust the KDC completely:

- **Won't eavesdrop** on your communications
- **Won't be compromised** by attackers
- **Won't go offline** when you need it

> A single point of trust is also a single point of failure.

## Real-World Example: Kerberos

**Kerberos** is a KDC protocol used in Windows Active Directory.

It improves on the basic model:

- **Tickets** - proof that KDC authenticated you
- **Timestamps** - prevents replay attacks
- **Two servers** - Authentication Server + Ticket Granting Server

Every time you log into a Windows domain, Kerberos is working behind the scenes.

## Why KDCs Are Limited

KDCs work well in **closed environments** like corporate networks.

They don't work for the internet:

- **Who runs the KDC?** No single entity everyone trusts
- **Billions of users** - doesn't scale
- **Global availability** - KDC must never go down
